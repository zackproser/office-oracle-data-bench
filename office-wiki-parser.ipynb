{'source': '../working/3_19_The_Negotiation.md'}\ndoc: page_content='The episode opens with Roy waiting outside the building, presumably for Jim. Inside, Jim is talking to Karen on what they should do for the night. An infuriated Roy makes his way up to the office, first to speak to Pam until he sees Jim with Karen. He calls Jim by his last name, and advances on him with his fist raised. Pam screams at Roy to stop and Jim pushes Karen out of the way. As soon as Roy gets his hands on Jim, Dwight sprays large amounts of pepper spray at Roy (it spreads throughout the front of the office as well). In an interview, Dwight is seen crying, from the pepper spray, explaining that everybody laughed at him for bringing pepper spray in to the office. \"Who\\'s laughing now?\" he asks smugly.\\nA week later, Michael and Toby are talking to Jan over the speaker phone, and it is revealed that Roy has been fired, and that Darryl now wants a raise. In separate interviews, Pam says that the attack on Jim by Roy \"sucked\", and Jim says that he was lucky that Dwight had been there and that Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray. Dwight is then seen showing his cache of weapons that contains nun-chuks and ninja stars.\\nJim is then seen thanking Dwight, but Dwight will not accept the thanks. Jim then tries to give Dwight a gift, but Dwight claims he \"doesn\\'t want it, doesn\\'t need it, and won\\'t accept it\". In an interview, Dwight explains his reasoning for not accepting the thanks, saying the \"real heroes\" were superheroes. Meanwhile, Oscar tells Angela about Dwight\\'s brave efforts, and Angela struggles not to appear too enthralled, but is clearly very proud of Dwight.\\nMichael and Jim are then seen in Michael\\'s office, and Michael asks Jim to role-play as Darryl, asking for a raise. Michael is equipped with a list of negotiation tactics that he acquired from Wikipedia, \"the best thing ever\". In Michael\\'s first tactic, he lowers his voice to create a position of power, but Jim is less than impressed. Michael\\'s second tactic, \"leaving the room unexpectedly\", is a \"surprise\". When Michael leaves the room in their second role-play, somewhat expectedly, Jim starts talking quietly, stopping Michael on his way out the door, and confusing him.\\nLater, Dwight recites the attack on Jim to Toby rather monotonously, ending his description of the events with \"...the end\". After Dwight leaves, Kelly and Ryan begin arguing in the next cubicle, rather loudly, and Toby, in an interview, questions whether Michael would have moved Ryan in with Kelly as a way to punish him, well aware that the relationship between Toby and Michael is rather unpleasant.\\nMeanwhile, Darryl enters Michael\\'s office, and Michael employs a tactic in which he changes the location at the last second, presumably as another way to gain a position of power. In the conference room, Michael attempts to employ a tactic in which he declines to speak first, but fails. While Darryl and Michael enter a discussion relating to Darryl\\'s request for a raise, Michael stands and walks to the window, and Darryl notices that Michael is wearing a woman\\'s power-suit.\\nMichael quickly leaves the conference room, and desperately tries to prove Darryl wrong by getting Pam to look at his suit. Pam agrees that it is a woman\\'s suit, and Michael says in an interview that he got it out of a clothing bin. Kevin asks Michael who makes the suit, and Michael looks at the label on the inside of the jacket (which is lined with pink silk). The label reads \"MISSterious\". Michael shows Pam the back of his pants, which don\\'t use a belt, but thin elastic. Also, the pants don\\'t have any pockets.\\nMichael later regrets making one \"tiny\" little mistake in his negotiation: he \"wore a woman\\'s clothes\".\\nLater, Karen tells Angela about the attack on Jim, and Angela experiences a euphoric interest in Dwight\\'s bravery. Meanwhile, Michael is back to discussing Darryl\\'s raise, and uses his tactic of lowering his voice, but ends up simply talking with a slow, strained voice.\\nPam apologizes to Jim, and Jim accepts her apology, but seems slightly resentful at Pam and Roy\\'s connection. He comments on the way that Pam and Roy are \"bound to find their way back to one another eventually\". Still in discussion, Michael reveals to Darryl how much he makes each week, and Darryl seems to find Michael\\'s salary unbelievably low, especially considering how long Michael has been with the company (fourteen years).\\nMeanwhile, Jim offers Dwight a free beer after work, but Dwight refuses this gesture, as well. Jim confides in Karen as to why Dwight is so easy to play pranks on, but so hard to be nice to. Karen tries to help, but suggests that Jim simply \"try and sell some paper\" so that they can take a trip. Kevin and Creed are later seen giving Michael money, presumably because they found out about Michael\\'s low salary, and Stanley, in an interview, claims that Michael is still \"way overpaid\".\\nEventually, Darryl convinces Michael to ring Jan and ask for a raise for himself. Outside Michael\\'s office, Creed tells his version of the attack on Jim to Angela, but Creed is clearly confusing events, and Angela, disappointed, calls him \"useless\". Michael is then seen talking to Jan over the speaker phone, with Darryl nearby, and Jan says that Michael should come to Corporate Headquarters to negotiate a raise. Michael agrees, but almost backs out when he finds out he has to bring Toby. Michael is eventually convinced, though.\\nToby is grateful to get away from Ryan and Kelly\\'s bickering, and Michael, Darryl and Toby head to Corporate HQ in Darryl\\'s cramped truck.\\nOn the way there, Darryl says that his cousin has a big place in New York, and that Toby could stay with them. Michael says that he might stay, to which Darryl replies \"it\\'s not that big\". Meanwhile, Kelly is describing the attack on Jim to Angela, but Kelly gets a phone call, and says that Angela should just look at Toby\\'s report. While Kelly is on the phone, Angela takes the report from Toby\\'s desk.\\nAt Corporate HQ, Michael enters Jan\\'s office, with some encouragement from Darryl.\\nMeanwhile, Roy returns to the office with a security guard to get his last paycheck, and apologizes to Jim. Dwight tenses and stands up, but doesn\\'t do anything except discreetly take out his nun-chuks. On his way out, Roy convinces Pam to meet him for coffee after work to talk things through. As Roy leaves, Kevin warns Jim of Roy\\'s presence in the office.\\nAt Corporate Headquarters, the negotiation begins. Michael meets Jan\\'s new assistant, a young man, and asks Jan \"who\\'s the boy-toy?\". After specifically being told not to bring their relationship in to the negotiation, Michael, disappointed at Jan\\'s six percent raise offer, threatens Jan with no sex. Toby, who is being a third-party stand-in, writes something down, and Michael calls him a \"perv-ball\".\\nWhile getting coffee, it is initially tense between Pam and Roy, but eventually they talk openly. Roy is puzzled when Pam says she isn\\'t going to try to win Jim over, saying if she does not, then all of what had happened would be for nothing. They hug, Pam wipes a tear from her face, and they part ways. Back at the office, Jim leaves a fake certificate of bravery on Dwight\\'s desk, but Dwight unexpectedly sees through Jim\\'s ploy, and Jim is left once again with no way to repay Dwight for his bravery.\\nAt HQ, Toby is asked to leave the room and Michael tells Jan about all the bad things that had happened to him lately: \"I accidentally cross-dressed...and then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money...and then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby...and then your assistant was all young and hot...\". Jan eventually offers Michael a twelve percent raise.\\nMichael reflects in an interview about the day\\'s events. He claims that \"life isn\\'t about salary - it\\'s about perks, like having sex with Jan\", of which Jan is standing next to him and immediately rebuffs his comments as they leave. Back at the office, Angela tells Dwight about how proud she is of him, and they begin to passionately kiss. Jim emerges from the washroom and sees this from the window, a distance away. He quickly runs back inside the washroom, and says that he and Dwight are now even, because he won\\'t tell anybody about what he saw.\\nThe episode closes with Andy returning from anger management. \\xa0He enters the office seemingly ready to make amends with his co-workers. However, he can barely get a word out when Dwight hits him with the pepper spray and Andy falls to the floor in pain. Toby is then seen confiscating all of Dwight\\'s weapons (which include, a taser, a boomerang, handcuffs, a nightstick, a pair of brass knuckles, and a samurai sword) In an interview Dwight claims that unlike Hiro from Heroes and Bono, he is \"not a hero\".\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/3_19_The_Negotiation.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/4_7_Survivor_Man.md'}\ndoc: page_content='In order to show that he is capable of surviving in the wilderness, Michael decides to strand himself in the wilderness for a few days, leaving Jim in charge of the office. Michael blindfolds himself and has Dwight take him to a location deep in the forest. Michael instructs Dwight to leave after dropping him off, but Dwight, knowing that Michael does not have proper wilderness survival skills, stays behind and surreptitiously keeps an eye on Michael (even through the scope of his rifle).\\nMeanwhile, back at the office, Jim learns that it is \"birthday month\", a stretch of days that includes the birthdays of Creed, Meredith, and Oscar, Creed\\'s being on the particular day that Jim is left in charge. As his first order of business, Jim forgoes organizing a party for Creed, instead announcing that the three parties will be celebrated together. He begins to run into problems, however, when Creed and Meredith request two different types of cake. Additionally, Andy refuses to attend unless an ice cream cake is made. Toby also requests to be included in the party, as his party two months earlier was held at 4:58pm and thus scarcely attended. In a talking head interview, Jim belittles Toby\\'s request.\\nMichael proves to be completely incapable of living out in the wild by himself. With the only materials he has, he is only able to fashion himself more clothes out of a cut up pair of pants, eventually crudely creating shelter out of them. Unable to find food, Michael begins to try to eat a group of wild mushrooms, unaware that they are highly poisonous. Dwight blows his cover to tackle Michael and pull the mushrooms from his mouth.\\nBack at the office, after a brief meeting, Jim finds that no one likes his office-wide party idea, even provoking Phyllis to mistakenly refer to him as Michael. Once this has happened, Jim decides to have a traditional party solely for Creed. Michael and Dwight return in time for the lighting of the cake, with Michael expressing that he no longer has any desire to return to the wilderness, and Jim expressing his relief that Michael has returned to run the office.\\nThe Season 4 DVD contains a number of deleted scenes.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/4_7_Survivor_Man.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/7_17_Threat_Level_Midnight.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Erin tells everyone that Michael has completed his movie and will let everyone watch it if interested. In a talking head, Jim and Pam comment that the movie is a great lost film and stars each employee from years\\' past, \"It\\'s like a home movie, if Michael Scott did your home movie\" as Jim excitedly says. There was an original test of the movie, but everyone laughed because they thought it was a comedy, which Michael became offended by.\\nThe Office - Threat Level Midnight\"Makes all the girlies feel alright\"As Michael invites Holly to see the movie as well, Pam and Jim remind everyone not to laugh no matter what, so that they can see the whole movie. Michael then plays the movie for everyone in the conference room, with everyone cheering as the movie begins.\\nThe Narrator (Stanley) explains the story of Michael Scarn, \"the best secret agent in the business\" as newspaper clippings of his previous exploits of saving the NFL, MBA and NBA All-Star games are shown, along with news that his wife, Catherine Zeta Scarn was murdered by a man called Goldenface. A final news clipping is shown that Scarn has retired to \"become a mild mannered paper salesman.\" Lying hungover in his bed, Scarn is awoken by his butler, Samuel Chan (Dwight). In a talking head, Dwight explains that he plays a robot butler, but Michael decided that Samuel was to be a very advanced android, thus being almost human in behavior. In another talking head, Michael insists that Dwight\\'s character is not a robot. Back in the movie, Samuel tells Scarn that the President needs him for a mission, but Scarn insists that he is retired, until it is revealed that Goldenface is involved as \"this makes it personal.\" In the Oval Office (the conference room redecorated), the President is shown to be played by Darryl, who reveals in a talking head that he took the role as he thought his daughter would benefit from seeing a black man as President, even if it was just in Michael\\'s movie. Now that Obama is President, Darryl calls being in the movie a \"what a stupid waste of time.\" In the movie, the President explains that Goldenface is planning to bomb the NHL All-Star Game, as well as taken all the concession stand workers hostage. The President also tells Scarn that his personal for him, since the stadium to be bombed is owned by him and is his retirement plan. After flipping a coin ten times to decide, Scarn accepts and says \"Looks like there\\'s gonna be a cleanup on aisle five.\" The office members cheer in the conference room, to Michael\\'s delight.\\nThe movie continues to show the hostages in the stadium, held by Goldenface (Jim), who are worried that no one will come for them. Goldenface tells them that \"Someone is coming alright, the only man who would care, Michael Scarn.\" He further reveals that his plan is to lure Scarn to the stadium, kill everyone, \"then I\\'m gonna dig up Scarn\\'s wife and I\\'m gonna hump her real good\" laughing as he finishes. As everyone in the conference room watches the scene uncomfortably, Jim reveals in a talking head that he did not love the dialogue nor the character, only choosing to take the part in the first place \"to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.\" Back in the movie, Scarn is seen driving as the Narrator explains that since tickets to the All-Star Game were sold out, he needed to get into the game as a player. Not knowing how to play hockey, he goes to learn from famed trainer, Cherokee Jack (Creed). Cherokee Jack then tells Scarn to mop the ice, as a training montage begins. After some time, Cherokee Jack hands Scarn a hockey stick, and he is shown to be proficient in hockey, as the Narrator explains that Scarn was now becoming one of the hottest hockey players in the country. The scene then shows a coach (Ryan) explaining to Scarn and two other contestants that each year the National Hockey League accepts one civilian amateur to play in the All-Star Game. The final test is speed skating, but as the race begins, one of the contestants reveals himself to be Goldenface who engages in a shootout with Scarn. After they both run out of bullets, Scarn tells Goldenface that he failed to kill him, but the latter reveals he wasn\\'t trying to kill him, but slow him down. Scarn then turns around to see the third contestant (Oscar) has been crowned the winner, as Goldenface further mocks Scarn by asking \"How\\'s your wife doing?\" In the locker room afterwards, Scarn takes an American flag and strangles the contestant to steal his medal and place in the All-Star Game, as back in the conference room everyone watches uncomfortably. In the movie, Scarn is seen sipping coffee back at his house, when Samuel reveals he has intercepted a name, Jasmine Windsong, but does not know what \"The Funky Cat\" is. Scarn tells Samuel that \"The Funky Cat\" is the name of a popular jazz club. As he leaves, he spills his drink on Samuel and the scene changes. In a talking head, Dwight complains that the following scene would have shown Samuel\\'s circuit board malfunctioning, upset that the drink was spilled on him for no reason. In the movie, Jasmine Windsong is shown to be played by Jan. The documentary crew try to ask Jan about it in reality, as she tries to get into her car while flustered. Jasmine Windsong sings a strange song, but when Scarn records it and plays it backwards, it reveals \"The hostages are under the stadium.\" Unfortunately, an assassin (Troy) sent by Goldenface murders her shortly after, as Scarn solemnly asks for the check. The scene cuts to the stadium, where a hostage (Pam) begs Goldenface to let them go. Wanting to show that he means business, Goldenface shoots a hostage (Toby), and the shot of the hostage\\'s head exploding is replayed numerous times. Back in the conference room, Michael watches the scene of Toby\\'s head exploding being repeated and smiles happily, revealing in a talking head that while that scene was the most expensive to shoot, \"it was \\'intregral\\' to the story.\" Scarn and Samuel arrive at the location of the hostages, as Goldenface taunts Scarn about the death of the hostage he shot, Scarn reveals \"the jokes on you Goldenface, that man was a wanted animal rapist.\" Having searched the entire stadium, Samuel demands to know where the bomb is (having to repeat his question several times as Jim pretends to be unable to hear him), which Goldenface reveals is in the puck, which he tosses to Scarn. The latter asks why he would reveal the location of the bomb, and Goldenface reveals that he will kill Scarn, unless he forgives him for killing his wife. Reminiscing about his wife while holding the puck, Scarn yells \"Go puck yourself!\" and hurls the puck at Goldenface who dodges it and prepares to shoot Scarn. As he is about to pull the trigger, Samuel screams and dives in front of Scarn to shield him, which Michael reveals was not scripted. Goldenface then shoots Scarn as the screen fades to black.\\nAs Scarn comes to his senses, the camera shows a scantily clad nurse attending to him, played by Helene to Pam\\'s horror. As the nurse comments that Scarn is lucky to be alive, Scarn says \"It\\'ll take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back and balls to kill Michael Scarn.\" The nurse then says they should \"make sure everything is working properly\", as she leans in to kiss Scarn while the heart monitor begins to accelerate, while back in the conference room a disturbed Pam watches while clutching Jim\\'s arm. Having fully recovered, Scarn tells the President that the bomb is in the puck, who in a surprising turn of events, calls in Goldenface and his assassin. Samuel questions why the President would blow up his own stadium, which Scarn realizes is to claim the insurance money. As the three villains attempt to open fire, Scarn smashes a picture of Abraham Lincoln on the President\\'s head and escapes with Samuel. Scarn then muses while standing in the rain that all he wanted was to start a family with his beautiful wife, wondering where things had gone wrong. Scarn enters a bar as the Narrator comments \"It wasn\\'t easy for Scarn to admit he\\'d lost his self-confidence, and he hadn\\'t of course, he just wasn\\'t using it right now.\" In the bar, Scarn talks to the bartender, Billy (Andy), about his problems. Billy tells Scarn that a table of bachelorettes bought him a drink, and as Scarn turns to face them, one of the bachelorettes (Karen) asks him \"Ever banged an entire bachelorette party, baby?\" In an interview with the documentary crew, Karen asks \"why are you singling my line out, like a million years later?\" Scarn tells Billy that he is too depressed to save the game, and Billy decides to cheer him up by getting him to do \"The Scarn\", a dance that Scarn hasn\\'t done since his wife died. Scarn then begins to dance as the entire bar joins in, regaining his confidence. Jim struggles to contain his laughter during the dance, despite Pam\\'s insistence, and bursts out laughing when Todd Packer appears and shouts \"If doing the Scarn is gay, then I\\'m the biggest queer on Earth!\" Upset that Jim was laughing, Michael pauses the movie, upon which Jim apologizes and says he was just relived to see Scarn regain his confidence. Not wanting Michael to stop the movie, the office members insist that it is a good movie, and showers it with praise. Satisfied with their response, Michael asks Holly if she liked the movie, but she simply asks \"which part?\" Upset that Holly doesn\\'t seem to like the movie, Michael insists that the movie is not ready yet and stops the viewing.\\nMichael approaches Holly in the annex who tells him it was a good movie, but Michael tells her everyone else said great movie instead. He asks her what she loved about the movie, and she says she loved that Michael was able to work with all his friends in it. Michael is unhappy with her answer and asks what she doesn\\'t like about the movie, and she hesitates to say. Michael briefly wonders if Holly doesn\\'t like the movie because she is afraid that he will become famous and leave her, but she assures him that is not the case. Michael then angrily tells Holly that the movie was his dream for eleven years, which surprises Holly since he has never mentioned it before. She asks him why he needs to make a movie in the first place, and Michael sighs that if he doesn\\'t have his movie, he doesn\\'t have anything. Holly asks, \"Really? You can\\'t think of anything else that you might have?\" Oblivious to what Holly is hinting, he lists his other ideas for television shows and books, but insists that his movie is the most real thing to him. As Holly says that she is real, Michael snaps \"Yeah, you\\'re a real pain in the ass.\" He then says he will watch the movie with people who love it, and apologizes for what he said, telling her he loves her before storming out of the annex. In a talking head, Michael compares himself to Woody Allen and his movie Antz, but gets lost in his comparison and states \"Don\\'t listen to your critics, listen to your fans.\" Michael then invites the rest of the Scranton branch to finish watching the movie, which they happily agree to. \\nThe movie shows Scarn arriving at the hockey game, but he learns that his trainer, Cherokee Jack, has died. Scarn dedicates his performance in the game to his mentor, and proceeds to join the game. Back in the conference room, Michael looks at the empty seat next to him where Holly should be, and decides not to take his movie too seriously. He reveals facts about the movie, such as the hockey scene being shown was filmed during an actual Scranton High School hockey game, which he admits was \"really screwed up, because they were trying to qualify for State\", and as a result of entering the rink he had got them disqualified since they had to forfeit the game, after it was an undefeated season. Michael sees Holly outside the conference room and goes to her, as she tells him she is sorry for what she said and that it is a good movie, he replies that she doesn\\'t have to lie and kisses her. He comments that while the movie isn\\'t good, the Scranton branch seem to be enjoying it anyway. In the movie, Scarn has a vision of Cherokee Jack, who tells him to take all his frustrations out on the puck, \"all on the puck\" which Michael snickers at. Scarn dramatically hits the puck out of the stadium. It flies into space and hits a satellite, before landing on Goldenface and exploding as Samuel rescues the hostages. Scarn is then crowned champion of the NHL All-Star Game. Scarn is seen having breakfast in his house, and gives Samuel his own \"breakfast\", drops of oil that are dropped onto his circuit board, causing Michael to remember he did tell Dwight he was a robot. Scarn then answers the phone, and the President asks him to go on another mission, which he accepts.\\nMichael Scott as Michael Scarn After Holly and Michael reenter the conference room, the office begins laughing freely at the absurdity of it all. As Andy asks why Scarn would accept a mission from the President, who is a villian. Dwight tries to defend the movie, but Michael just comments \"No, he\\'s just being stupid.\" The movie ends as the Narrator reveals that the reason he has so much knowledge about Michael Scarn, is because he himself is an elderly Michael Scarn. The office cheers as the credits to the movie begin to roll.\\nWriter B.J. Novak said that the episode came in far too long, and they had to cut large quantities.\\nAfter the episode aired, the show created a Web site for the movie: www.threatlevelmidnight.com.

On camera, he\\'s trying to blow it off as not a big deal, until he bites his lip again, at which point he gives up and decides to take the rest of the day off.\\nPam comes into the office looking so tired and disheveled that Erin mistakes her for Meredith. Pam explains that Jim has been spending a few days a week in Philadelphia working on his new company and that she has been taking care of the kids. She also explains that Cece\\xa0recently got lice and she was awake all night disinfecting everything in the house.\\nMeanwhile, Jim is in Philadelphia and is very excited as he is about to meet Julius Erving, also known as Dr. J, a famous former NBA player.

Dwight believes everyone should shave their head and Erin says that they can use mayonnaise to kill the lice easily. They go with the mayonnaise plan, and Pam makes a trip to the store for it. When she gets back to the office and starts unloading her car, she calls Jim. He asks Dr. J if he can take the call from his wife and Dr. J encourages him to take it. They have a short conversation during which Pam drops two jars of mayonnaise on the ground and they spill everywhere.\\nEveryone except Dwight partners up to apply mayonnaise to each other\\'s heads. The partners are: Pete and Erin, Oscar and Angela, Meredith and Stanley, leaving Pam to partner with Creed. Creed ironically complains that he\\'s left with the weird one in the office.\\nWhile putting mayo in Oscar\\'s hair, Angela becomes subtly aggressive: slapping him in the face while putting on the mayo, letting excess mayonnaise run down his face and neck, and hitting him in the head with a coffee pot while rinsing out the water. In the annex Pete and Erin have fun together as they put on their mayonnaise, laughing and imitating different characters, and after Creed abandons Pam she is forced to put it on by herself.\\nPhyllis, Kevin, and Nellie convince Val to give Darryl another chance. Val finally agrees that maybe they should continue their relationship, much to Darryl\\'s chagrin and he sadly tells the cameras that he and Val are back together.\\nBack in the office Dwight announces that he has bought a \"insecticidal grenade\" which he plans to detonate in the office, but as he is talking to the group he fumbles it and the bomb instantly detonates in his closed office. Dwight then says the exploded bomb seems to have hallucinogenic effects and, after speaking nonsensically, he faints.\\nAs Erin readies herself to rinse the mayo off of Pete\\'s head he removes his shirt, revealing a toned body beneath his undershirt, and draws Erin\\'s attention, although she looks quickly away. She begins washing the mayonnaise out of his hair affectionately and asks if it\\'s too cold. He says no and they both give a small smile.\\nWhen Pam is spreading mayonnaise into her hair by herself she receives a phone call and, as her hands are covered in mayo, she is unable to answer it and puts the phone on speaker instead. On the other end it is Helene\\xa0who tells her that she has just picked up Cece after she was sent home from school because she still has lice. As the phone is on speaker everyone in the office hears the call and they furiously shout at Pam for bringing in the lice and letting Meredith take the blame. Meredith angrily demands Pam shave her head.\\nPam and Meredith singing \"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\"When Pete stops by Erin\\'s desk he finds it empty and Oscar tells him that she has already gone home for the day. Pete looks visibly saddened by the news, but Erin is actually standing by the supply shelves and sees his reaction. In the parking lot Dwight tells the camera he is ready to deal with lice and accidentally drops another lice bomb, which detonates in his car.\\nPam calls Jim again and leaves him a message as he does not see that she is calling him because he is busy playing basketball with Dr. J. Overhearing Pam\\'s sad voicemail message for Jim, Meredith invites her out for a drink and Pam smiles and agrees, relieved. At the bar Pam admits she is impressed by Meredith\\'s ability to have been a single mom all these years and the two look happy, the episode ending with Pam and Meredith singing karaoke at the bar and appearing to have a good time.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/9_10_Lice.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/8_10_Christmas_Wishes.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Andy attempts to make everyone\\'s Christmas wishes come true. At a conference meeting, he vows to keep his promise to make wishes and asks the office members to also be nice to his new girlfriend Jessica. An emotionally confused Erin tries to be nice to Jessica, but ends up drinking too much at the party. In a drunken stupor, she tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die. Kelly does her part as a friend of Erin\\'s by being mean to Jessica. Andy becomes concerned about Erin\\'s behavior, not least because Robert has revealed that his marriage is ending and spends a good deal of the party hanging out with Erin. When Andy has to drive a drunken Meredith home, he sees Erin getting into Robert\\'s car and he follows them with a look of panic on his face. However, he covertly witnesses Robert being a gentleman and sending Erin off to her apartment with a hug and words of encouragement, and drives away with a smile on his face.\\nMeanwhile, Dwight and Jim\\'s pranking has caused Kathy to ask Andy to move her to a different desk. In turn, Andy sternly tells Dwight and Jim to quit their childish behavior. He tells them that the next one to pull a prank will lose their Christmas bonus, and the target of the prank will get the prankster\\'s share. Unfortunately, Andy\\'s plan backfires, as both Dwight and Jim attempt to frame the other. Jim loudly releases his credit card information hoping Dwight will steal it and buy something ridiculous. However, Dwight orders a $200 dollar bouquet of flowers for Pam. Dwight then proceeds to put a porcupine in his desk and blame Jim. However, a verbal slip-up causes him to inadvertently reveal his intentions. Jim, in retaliation, defaces a picture of his daughter, Cece, and blames Dwight. After Andy mentions that defacing a picture is a fireable offense, Jim admits he staged the crime. Andy admits to Jim that he\\'s nixing the bonus-loss plan, he just wants their behavior to not interfere with their job performances. Jim promises Andy to tone the jokes down and tells him he will tell Dwight. Meanwhile, Dwight continues to deface his own property, writing \"Jim is awesome\" on his car and \"Idiot\" on his forehead. Jim, smirking, tells the camera that he needed to tell Dwight something, but can\\'t quite remember.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/8_10_Christmas_Wishes.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/4_7_and_8_Money.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Michael and Jan sit in Michael\\'s office talking about renovating their condo, not able to decide which type of flooring they want.

Jim and Pam decide to spend the night there, finding the operation even stranger than they had imagined. They take part in Dwight and Mose\\'s table-making demonstration, watch Mose produce wine from beets, and even have Dwight read Harry Potter as a bedtime story. Jim also begins to recognize the extent of Dwight\\'s depression over the loss of Angela.\\nMichael begins leaving the office early, refusing to explain his reasons to Pam (and telling Jan that he\\'s taking a nighttime improv class). It is revealed that Michael has loads of debt and had to get a second job as a telemarketer, taking the bus there immediately after leaving Dunder Mifflin. There, he works until 1 A.M. In one instance, he calls a \"Mr. Hudson.\" It turns out to be Stanley from Dunder Mifflin, who recognizes his voice (but assumes it\\'s a joke).\\nRyan arrives at the office to supervise Michael\\'s first PowerPoint presentation. However, Michael is unprepared. In the process of defending himself, he inadvertently acknowledges that he has taken a second job. As Michael\\'s lack of being prepared for the presentation is seemingly a result of his second job, Ryan orders Michael to quit the other job or face termination. Michael reluctantly agrees.\\nDuring the meeting, it is revealed that Kelly is dating Darryl. The relationship turns out to be quite dysfunctional, as Kelly is mainly concerned with making Ryan jealous. Darryl realizes this, but finds that Kelly\\'s scheming actually turns him on. Kelly, on the other hand, is perplexed by the fact that Darryl never seems to have any hidden agenda, but always means exactly what he says.\\nAfter Michael devises some desperate schemes to come up with more money, Creed encourages him to just declare bankruptcy. Unaware of what that entails, Michael takes the advice literally and announces \"I declare bankruptcy!\" to the office, thinking that is all that is required. Seeing Michael\\'s desperation, Oscar agrees to look over his financial situation and finds that he spends a lot of money on stuff \"no one ever, ever needs\" such as a core blaster extreme exercise machine, professional bass fishing equipment, and multiple magic sets.\\nOscar convinces Michael to discuss the situation with Jan over the phone, but she immediately harangues Michael about being irresponsible. In the middle of her diatribe, Michael runs out of the office in a failed attempt to hop a train. Jan arrives and attempts to console Michael, saying she appreciates the fact that he was there for her when she was fired. Michael fails to confront Jan about her role in his financial problems, and insists that his lack of money is no reason to have her breast augmentation reversed.\\nAndy gives Angela a cat he discovered in the Vance Refrigeration office as part of his continuing effort to court her. It is the same cat, named Garbage, Dwight unsuccessfully tried to give her (in Dunder Mifflin Infinity) to make amends for his mercy killing of her cat Sprinkles. This time it works, and she gives Andy permission to ask her to dinner, with several provisos about what they will be eating. After seeing this exchange, Dwight sits alone in the stairway of Dunder Mifflin, crushed. Jim attempts to console Dwight, relaying that the pain of his own rebuffed affection for Pam is what caused him to leave for Stamford, and was so awful that \"it is something that I wouldn\\'t wish on my worst enemy -- and that includes you\". On his way back into the office, Jim spends a last moment remembering how much he\\'d suffered when he couldn\\'t be with Pam. He shakes it off and walks over to passionately kiss her in full view of everyone. Though surprised, Pam responds without a moment\\'s hesitation, and then they discuss eating Italian food for dinner. In an interview Pam says coyly that Jim is passionate about Italian food. Jim responds in his own interview that he is in love with Italian food, implying that he\\'s actually in love with Pam. Soon after, seemingly aided by Jim\\'s outreach, Dwight returns to his desk and resumes his more typical, obnoxious behavior. He silently pushes away Jim\\'s work materials that have started to encroach on his desk and makes a sales call. Jim and Pam share a poignant smile, knowing that they have helped Dwight get over Angela.\\nDespite initial appearances, Michael\\'s money troubles are not due to Jan spending extravagantly. Oscar points out that a reasonable proportion is spent on necessities and a few luxuries but most of the income is spent on things \"no one could ever ever need.\" In a deleted scene, Michael is shown to have substantial credit card debt. It is likely that Michael had spent most of his income on whimsical items such as professional bass fishing equipment, various exercise equipment and magic sets. In a deleted scene, we learn that instead of saving his extra money, he used it to buy music CDs (confusing them with certificates of deposit).\\nAt the start of the episode Jan purchases a couch as Michael only owns a futon. Michael\\'s problems begin after Jan convinces him to spend his money on necessities such as furniture. Michael had been living very close to the limit of his income, almost paycheck-to-paycheck. Since he didn\\'t cut down on his whimsical spending, Jan\\'s extra spending pushed him over the edge.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/4_7_and_8_Money.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/8_15_Tallahassee.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Dwight discusses the plan he has for the office staff on how their trip will go.

Jim, who has been up for a while, has set his hotel room up to look like he has been targeted by a gang and then proceeds to drop out of the closet pretending to be dead upon Dwight and Erin\\'s arrival.\\nDwight prepares for the important meeting they are to have with Nellie Bertram, the company\\'s Special Projects President. Jim runs into Stanley driving a red sports convertible with sunglasses and he invites Jim for a ride. At the meeting, Jim pranks Dwight by making him believe that he has poisoned Dwight. Nellie Bertram then arrives and begins to talk about the special project they are all here to work on. Jim and Dwight are horrified when they realize that Todd Packer is here as well, having landed on his feet after they sent him to Florida to pursue a fake corporate job as a ploy to get rid of him. Dwight begins to realize that he has severe pains and realizes he has to go to the hospital. He begins to leave as he is in horrible pain but suddenly realizes that Nellie is offering the position of VP of the project to anyone who can \"wow her\". Dwight decides to ignore his injury and stay. He attempts to participate but eventually falls over and is escorted to the hospital.\\nAt the office, the staff begin to wonder why it\\'s so quiet. They suddenly realize it\\'s because Erin has put all the phones on silent and there is no one to be the receptionist. After a failed attempt to get Pam to fill in at reception, Andy volunteers and begins to realize he really likes the job.\\nDwight returns to the meeting, hours after having had an appendectomy. He joins Jim, Ryan, Cathy, Erin, and Stanley as all the people have broken off into groups to all do a sales related presentation. Dwight decides to give the presentation despite being the only group member to not do any research or help with the PowerPoint. After nearly butchering the presentation, he finally impresses Bertram by telling the audience that the only element of marketing that matters is \"desire.\" Bertram subsequently invites Packer and Dwight to have breakfast with her the following day.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/8_15_Tallahassee.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/4_17_Job_Fair.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Michael, Pam, Oscar and Darryl set up a booth at a local job fair at Valley View High School, which happens to be Pam\\'s alma mater, to find the \"Best and the Brightest\" for Dunder Mifflin\\'s summer internship.

The client Jim is trying to impress, Phil Maguire, suggests they bet on the golf game, which excites Kevin, as he both loves to gamble and proves to be an excellent golfer. Andy, on the other hand, is quite a poor golfer. The employees realize there is no reason for them to be in the office with so many people gone and want to go home. Stanley quietly packs his things and walks out as Dwight becomes outraged that everyone wants to leave.\\nAt the job fair, Michael turns away the only student interested in their booth because he is not the type of person Michael was interested in recruiting. He then gets mad that the student signed his name on the sheet of paper and tells Pam to put out another. Pam only brought one, and when Michael gets mad at her, she points out that he told her to only bring one sheet. Michael pushes the blame back on her and makes her go find another piece of paper.\\nJim tries to convince the client to switch paper companies, but Phil is content with the supplier he is using and is not interested in hearing a sales pitch. Michael tries to pull other students in to the booth but no one is interested. Back at the office, Angela and Dwight find themselves alone as the rest of the employees decide to go home.\\nPam finds a piece of paper from her old art room and returns to the booth with it, but Michael is mad that it is not Dunder Mifflin paper and makes Pam go back to the office to retrieve another sheet. Meanwhile, Dwight calls Michael with the news that the employees left but Michael agrees that no one should have to be there as both he and Jim are gone and hangs up.\\nThe sales pitch does not seem to be going well for Jim, but he is determined to give it his best shot. After getting shot down again, Andy, in an attempt to be funny, suggests racing to the next hole and crashes the golf cart into a sand trap. Michael becomes disgusted with how well the rest of the booths are doing. Michael tries to re-recruit Justin, the only student who showed an interest in the company, but Justin tells Michael he was a jerk and walks away.\\nAfter the golf game, Jim delivers one last desperate sales pitch and Phil finally breaks down and gives Dunder Mifflin his business. As the job fair starts to wrap up, Michael grabs the microphone and, like Jim, delivers one last desperate sales pitch to get anyone to intern at the company, but he gets no takers.\\nIn his final talking head, Michael justifies his failure at the job fair by accepting credit for Jim\\'s success, as Jim chooses to work at Dunder Mifflin.\\nThe final scene shows Pam walking over to a graphic design booth during the job fair and asking for an application. Although Pam is intimidated when the graphic design interviewer lists several programs that she is unfamiliar with, the interviewer states that it should be easy to find adult education programs to help Pam learn them.\\nPeacock released additional deleted scenes from this episode:\\nNo\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/4_17_Job_Fair.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/5_4_Baby_Shower.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Dwight acts out the process of childbirth with a watermelon so\\xa0Michael\\xa0can be prepared for the arrival of\\xa0Jan\\'s baby.

A small number of people will be transferred to Stamford while the rest (including Michael) will receive severance packages. Michael takes the news badly, and it isn\\'t long before he spills the beans to the office prematurely.\\nReactions to the news vary, as revealed in a series of talking head interviews. Stanley is thrilled and looks forward to retiring and traveling with his wife, Ryan notes the irony that the news is announced the day he receives his business cards, Angela calmly blames everyone, and a distraught Kelly threatens to kill herself if Ryan loses his job while she gets to keep hers, just like Romeo and Juliet (the Claire Danes version). Jim notes Scranton\\'s closing with a tinge of disappointment, and Pam considers it a blessing in disguise, since she has started catching herself answering her home phone with \"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.\" Roy is unsure whether he wants to keep working at the warehouse if Pam leaves. But the warehouse workers are not in danger: The new warehouse owner Bob Vance (of Vance Refrigeration) offered to retain the warehouse crew.\\nMichael has a plan: He will confront the CFO at the New York office to get him to change his mind. As he and Dwight drive to New York, Michael learns that the CFO is out of the office for the day, so the confrontation will take place at the CFO\\'s home instead.\\nIn the break room, Ryan breaks up with Kelly, explaining that their relationship would not work out since they will no longer be working together. In a talking head interview, Ryan is pleased: He got valuable work experience, he will get a great recommendation letter from Michael, and he broke up with Kelly.\\nAmidst the celebration at the Stamford branch, Jan informs their branch manager Josh that he will be taking over the newly-formed division Dunder Mifflin Northeast, which will be all of the offices north of Stamford. Josh turns down the offer, however, revealing that he has leveraged the situation to obtain a senior management position at Dunder Mifflin\\'s main competitor Staples. This throws the entire restructuring into disarray. Jim remarks in a talking head interview, \"Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.\"\\nMichael and Dwight arrive at the CFO\\'s residence to find nobody home. While waiting for the CFO to return, Dwight helps Michael develop \"an attack plan\" and they rehearse what Michael will say.\\nJan returns to the conference room and informs Jim that the new plan is for Scranton to absorb Stamford. She offers Jim the number two position at the Scranton branch, but Jim is unsure, as he has unresolved personal issues at the Scranton branch (which Jan assumes are due to Michael). Karen and Jim discuss the situation, and Karen says that if asked, she would go to Scranton. Jim is still undecided but suggests that Karen investigate job opportunities in New York rather than moving to Scranton. As for Andy, he creates a mess in the break room in frustration.\\nJan returns to the Scranton branch, only to find chaos: Michael is gone, Stanley happily packs up his things, and Ryan flings his new business cards into the air. Demanding an explanation, Jan learns that Michael had told them of the branch\\'s closing, at which point she informs them that their branch is not closing after all. With the exception of Stanley, the office is relieved that their jobs are safe. (Even Kevin and Angela embrace upon hearing the news.) They decide to go out to celebrate. Pam anxiously asks Jan whether anyone from Stamford is coming back to Scranton. Kelly is thrilled that she and Ryan don\\'t have to break up now that their jobs are safe.\\nWhile Pam justifies in a talking head interview that keeping her job saves her the trouble of adjusting to a new one, Jim agonizes over whether he should return to Scranton or not. He informs Karen that he has decided to accept the position and suggests that she go there if offered a job. In a talking head interview, Karen admits that she is glad he said it, because even though she does not think he is into her, she is kind of into him.\\nNight has fallen, and Michael and Dwight continue to wait for the CFO to come home. Pam calls Michael\\'s cell phone to let him know that the Scranton branch is safe, but he refuses to answer calls from the office until he can give them \"good news.\" As it gets later, Michael gets more and more despondent. While Dwight steps away to check his voicemail, Michael, talking to himself, finally accepts defeat, lying on the sidewalk and bitterly accepting his failure - only to be interrupted by a scream from Dwight, who tells him that the Scranton branch has been saved. As the reality of this statement finally sinks in, the pair joyfully celebrate their success, unsure exactly how they accomplished it.\\nAs he heads home from work, Toby tells the documentary crew that he dreamed of selling his house, moving to Costa Rica, and learning how to surf, plans which had to be put on hold when the Scranton branch was saved. \"Costa Rica will still be there... when I\\'m 65.\"\\nIn subplots, Meredith seeks a potential paramour based on a deal she once made to get physical with a coworker on the final day of employ, and Creed sells the electronics and furniture from his area of the office.\\nMeredith first believes that she makes the future sexual liaison pact with Michael, but he says it is not so. Toby is equally unhelpful on the matter. Finally, Gary Trundle, Meredith\\'s former coworker from another branch\\'s warehouse, calls to remind her of a deal he had made with her long ago. Meredith asks him to be at her place in 20 minutes. She confirms the closing to Gary even though she knows that the decision to close has been reversed, initially telling him the truth before cutting herself off to plan the rendezvous.\\nDwight searches through the CFO\\'s garbage outside his home, learning that he is rich (as he has a satellite TV bill) and drinks coffee, \"possibly to disguise the smell of cocaine.\"\\nPam\\'s line about the closing being a blessing has been changed from her being able to no longer answer her home phone \"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam\" to her fantasy about quitting.\\nJim\\'s line about his theory that Scranton would close \"because Michael sold the building for magic beans\" is changed to an awkward high school reunion that ends up with everyone moving in with him.\\nAndy asks Jim what he\\'s going to do if he should get laid off. When Jim asks Andy, he says that Cornell has a great alumni network and he might go back there to teach. Jim then asks where he went to college, mocking Andy\\'s frequent reference to his alma mater.\\nIn an extended scene, we find out that Ryan and Kelly\\'s relationship may be more than it seems. Kelly appears to have a strange power over Ryan. He claims he \"can\\'t explain\" the attraction and why they remain together.\\nKelly asks Pam to sign her company directory as a memento.

He makes several deals throughout the day and ultimately earns $1,200 selling Dunder Mifflin property from a branch now scheduled to remain open (giving proper context to Kevin\\'s line, which remained in the aired version, that Creed would be paying for the post-work celebration at Poor Richard\\'s).\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/3_7_Branch_Closing.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/5_1_and_2_Weight_Loss.md'}\ndoc: page_content='The Scranton branch participates in a weight loss competition to see which branch can lose the most cumulative weight, with a prize of three extra vacation days (which later changes to five due to every branch performing poorly) for every employee in the winning branch.

As a result, corporate sends a memo insisting that the staff need not resort to drastic measures to lose weight.\\nPam begins her three-month stay in New York to attend classes in graphic design at the Pratt Institute, leaving Jim to adjust to her being away. Pam is temporarily replaced by Ronni, an older woman, and she is quickly replaced by Ryan, who was recently fired by Dunder Mifflin for fraud. Ryan, who is shown to be planning to rise again in the company, tries to make up with several workers he had treated badly. He apologizes to his former girlfriend Kelly, and asks her out, only to be rejected because she\\'s dating Darryl, and is mocked by Jim when Ryan apologizes to him.\\nMichael successfully continues his casual bonding with Holly, with Jim noting that his success is due to Holly being \"kind of a major dork\". However, when Holly notices Michael talking in his office with a pregnant Jan, she asks Oscar\\xa0to set her up with his yoga instructor. Michael learns of this and gets frustrated with Jim because he did not ask Holly out months earlier, which he wanted to but Jim told him not to. At one point, Angela chastises Kevin for improperly accounting for sales numbers. Holly, who thinks Kevin is mentally challenged, yells at Angela for treating Kevin so rudely, but when she refers to him as \"mentally challenged,\"\\xa0Kevin awkwardly reveals that he is not. Embarrassed, Holly apologizes and walks away.\\nDue to the poor results of the Scranton branch weigh ins, Dwight “randomly selects” Kevin, Phyllis and Stanley to get liposuction surgery. An insulted Phyllis is later approached by Dwight, who attempts to apologize by recruiting her for a two-person sale. Hours later, a sweaty and infuriated Phyllis returns to the office and reveals that there was no sale, and that Dwight left her in a warehouse five miles away without her purse or phone. Dwight tries to justify his actions by pointing out how many calories she burned on the walk home; in response, Phyllis calls corporate to report him.\\nDue to Dwight\\'s actions, the next weigh in is skipped. Holly tries to hold a meeting involving positive body images, but is sabotaged by Michael in his Michael Klump persona (achieved by wearing a plus-size outfit over one of his sumo suits from \"Beach Games\"). Michael argues that Michael Klump is a “celebration of fat people,” as opposed to Oscar and Kevin\\'s opinions that it is his “making fun of fat people character.” Michael forces an inauthentic apology out of Dwight, then reminds his subordinates that the weight loss contest was not just about weight loss, but positive body image and healthy lifestyles as a whole. He then requests that Kelly cease her unhealthy dieting habits and begin eating once again.\\nPhyllis takes over the Party Planning Committee after catching Angela cheating on Andy\\xa0with Dwight. Andy has been making plans\\xa0for his wedding with Angela, who irritatedly rejects all of his ideas. After Andy gives a heartfelt speech about not caring where they marry because he wants to be with her forever, Angela warms up to him a little.

Andy reacts by telling Oscar to express his opinions, only to have Oscar berate him for endangering his job. While Andy and Oscar are discussing what was to be done, Dwight waits in a severely long line to ask a question, only to run into trouble with the people waiting.\\nAs the meeting commences, the audience jeers and heckles each member coming onto the stage, with Michael uncomfortable with the situation. After strongly condemned by the audience and starting a break, Michael counters the company's critics by claiming a 45-day plan is on the way to resolve the crisis, only to make matters more difficult for the executive as there is no plan. Unable to figure out how to resolve the crisis, Michael invites Oscar to join the representatives, only to be embarrassed in front of the members as Oscar becomes nervous and decides to just thank the executives for their work. After Chris O'Keefe, former U.S. Congressman and board member of Dunder Mifflin, insults Michael, he counters the comments made by demanding more praise and insulting O'Keefe. Michael, alarmed when O'Keefe angrily states he and his colleagues can take the bus, makes a run for the limo with Andy, Oscar and Dwight and immediately heads back to Scranton. The camera then focuses on Dunder Mifflin's stock on a ticker tape which has dropped severely. It is later revealed that Dwight was up and able to speak at the microphone in the line, only to criticize about how the line for the microphone was slow and unproductive; this ends up confusing the entire audience who initially assumed he was talking about the future of Dunder Mifflin. \\nMeanwhile, Jim, being placed in charge during Michael's absence, is frustrated with Ryan and his unwillingness to work. Jim also becomes further annoyed when Ryan, attempting to undermine Jim's position, spreads rumors that Jim is not as much of a boss as Michael, leading to Jim being teased and disrespected by the other employees. After discussing the situation with Pam, who discourages him from yelling at Ryan in front of the others, Jim decides to make an example out of him. After catching Ryan playing games, Jim forces Ryan to relocate to a broom closet furnished with a desk and computer without internet access as the office watches. Ryan, embarrassed, attempts to apologize, but Jim shuts the door on him and walks away.\\n\" metadata={'source': '../working/6_11_Shareholder_Meeting.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/5_28_Company_Picnic.md'}\ndoc: page_content='The Scranton branch joins several other branches at the Dunder Mifflin Company Picnic.

In addition to his excitement, Michael also holds a \"marketing conference\" in the office. However, his idea backfires, as the company\\'s largest client, Blue Cross of Pennsylvania, receives one of these tickets. In fact, they got all five of the tickets, for a cumulative discount of 50%. (Michael did not specify \"limit one per customer\".) Michael, at first, berates Darryl for not properly labeling the shipments for the customers, although Darryl made it clear that Michael had to know that shipments close to each other meant they were headed to the same customer. Embarrassed, Michael disposes of his Willy Wonka attire and returns with Andy\\'s blazer, and starts a conference to get the branch out of the problem.\\nAll the employees are disgruntled and are furious with Michael as this could be cause for the branch to shut down during the current economic crisis, with Jim being upset with Michael for him losing half of his commission while he has to pay a mortgage. Soon Michael receives a call from CEO David Wallace, who is also furious and demands an explanation on the perpetrator responsible for the idea and why the idea was approved. Michael, not admitting that it was his idea, claims it was an \"inside job\" and blames it on one of the employees: Dwight. Soon, Dwight is seen talking with Michael, fighting over who was responsible for the idea, which Dwight clearly explains was Michael\\'s fault, with the help of his diary.\\nLater, Dwight and Michael are seen walking around, discussing loyalty and what Dunder Mifflin had offered Dwight. Michael also explains that true loyalty is to take the blame from Wallace and risk losing his job. Dwight considers accommodating Michael but has not made his mind up when Jim tries to talk him into letting Michael take responsibility for his actions. When Wallace comes in Michael, expecting Dwight to get fired, anxiously asks Dwight to take the blame for the golden ticket idea. Michael is appalled when Wallace tells them that due to the golden ticket idea, Blue Cross is making Dunder Mifflin its exclusive office supply provider. Dwight, having risked losing his job when the golden tickets were a bad idea, takes the credit as the office cheers \\'his\\' great idea. Wallace wants Dwight to talk to the Marketing department and as the telephone conference begins, Michael listens in then busts into the conference room to claim the credit. Michael becomes furious and complains that it was his idea and fights with Dwight to take credit. However, Wallace, unable to believe that Michael wants credit after having blamed a subordinate, becomes annoyed and leaves prematurely. Dwight and Michael later discuss to the camera about whose idea it was in their own words and begin to fight over Dwight\\'s diary.

Jim reveals to the camera that, while he was called for duty, he was dismissed at noon and headed home to Pam and their two children; he saw that Pam was overwhelmed and took the rest of the week off to help take care of their children. After \"reenacting\" the crime for his interested co-workers, Dwight begins to question Jim on every detail of his case. Dwight goes to great lengths to try and get Jim to reveal the truth, and figures out Jim was lying about jury duty. Ashamed, Jim admits his guilt to Andy who, although upset, understands Jim\\'s plight. He, therefore, agrees to help Jim cover up his story by telling the now-suspicious office workers that he drove Jim to the courthouse every morning, a ridiculous lie because Andy lives near the courthouse but a long way from Jim and Pam\\'s home.\\nSoon, Jim and Andy begin disagreeing whether they should continue the charade or admit the truth. Jim eventually does the latter, much to the chagrin of his fellow co-workers. Dwight is thrilled at the confession because Andy had said earlier he would fire Jim if he had lied about his absence, but Andy says he will not fire Jim, and instead gives him a mild-looking slap to the face as punishment. Dwight furiously calls up Gabe so he can turn Jim in and \"the office stickler will do what he does best...stickle!\" To smooth things over, Jim and Pam bring in their children, Cece and Phillip, to present pictures that they drew for the co-workers. It becomes clear that Jim and Pam drew the pictures themselves to appease their co-workers, but before the members of the office can berate the couple, Cece and Phillip simultaneously begin crying loudly, creating a cacophony that Jim and Pam struggle to control, and which shocks the office workers. Realizing the stress that having young children causes, the office workers, ultimately, do not blame Jim for his behavior and even suggest he leave early to help Pam.\\nMeanwhile, Angela and her husband, state senator Robert Lipton, welcome their new baby, also named Phillip. Oscar, Kevin, Erin, and Gabe all visit Angela at the hospital. According to Angela, the baby was born prematurely, but due to the size, Oscar correctly deduces that Angela lied about the date of conception. Angela admits that the baby was conceived a month before her wedding, but makes him promise not to tell anyone. Oscar later breaks his promise to Dwight, who barges in on Angela and her husband and begins thoroughly examining the child. When the senator leaves, Dwight confronts Angela about the child, claiming that it is his. She refutes his claim, but Dwight leaves satisfied, telling the attending nurse to call off the baby\\'s circumcision, which the nonplussed nurse refuses to do. Upon returning to Dunder Mifflin he drops his dispute with Jim, since his self-assumed fatherhood has given him a new appreciation for the duties of parenthood.

Darryl feels better and they all decide to start the interview over, this time, Darryl making a better joke.\\nAs Dwight and Clark continue to insult one another, the client\\'s son comes in. It is revealed that he is the boss and that his father mainly is in the job for the human companionship.

He throws the black dirt in everyone\\'s face except Oscar.

His cousin Zeke pulls up on his motorcycle to take Dwight to the funeral at Shirley\\'s farm nearby.

Dwight and Oscar meet at the funeral and Oscar expresses surprise when he see\\'s Dwight\\'s brother pull up in a car that drives into the grave intended for Aunt Shirley. Oscar is even more struck by Dwight\\'s beautiful sister, Fanny from Chicago. She is a single mother of a boy named Cameron.\\nWhile at the funeral, rather than recall fond memories of Shirley like most families, all the guests instead state a fact about her while she was alive to which Oscar sarcastically says of the Schrutes \"they\\'re a descriptive people\". A group of farmers arrive at the funeral and Dwight flirts with Esther, one of the girls from a neighboring farm. Oscar becomes worried and leaves after Dwight takes a shotgun and begins firing into the open coffin in order to ensure that Shirley is dead and not just a deep sleeper as incidents in the past have occurred.\\nBack at the office Todd Packer reappears and admits that he is in recovery and is on step 8 of Alcoholics Anonymous (and step 9 of Narcotics Anonymous) in which he must make amends with the people he has wronged. He proceeds to apologize to everyone, but Pam points out that he is just insulting people and disguising it as an apology. Packer realizes this and to show he is truly sorry, begins to distribute cupcakes that he bought for everyone. Everyone seems willing to accept his apology, but Pam calls a meeting in the conference room as she is not willing to let everyone forgive Packer just because he is handing out cupcakes.\\nAs everyone gathers in the living room at the funeral, they watch a tape Aunt Shirley recorded for her family to watch upon her death. In the video, she tells Dwight, his brother Jeb, and Fanny that she will give them her farm if they move back home. She thinks that Jeb, a pot farmer in California, and Fanny, a single mom in the city, need to return home and get back to their family traditions. Jeb seems interested, but Fanny doesn\\'t want to and Dwight\\'s usual means of manipulation don\\'t work on his sister.\\nPam convinces the office that they should not accept Packer\\'s offering. Meanwhile, Packer continues to insult people and Kevin struggles not to eat his cupcake as everyone tries to distract him.\\nDwight uses the tactic of nostalgia to convince his sister to return home. As the Schrute family sings, Fanny begins to realize that she misses her home and becomes impressed when Dwight begins to court Esther by placing a pair of crow\\'s beaks at her feet. According to Schrute tradition, if the girl is interested, she will crush the beaks, and Esther does. Dwight later goes to the barn at night and begins to do his usual work and Cameron follows him. He observes Dwight perform the task of taking eggs from hens and Cameron overcomes his fear of chickens to take an egg and Dwight seems proud. Dwight later tries to show him how to milk a goat, but when Cameron is unable to discern between good milk and bad milk, Dwight loses his patience and his uncle instincts prove fickle.\\nWhen Pam comes in the next morning, she announces that she thought about it and that she is going to eat her cupcake. The rest of the office looks terrible and they reveal to Pam that Packer had laced the cupcakes with a wide range of drugs. In an earlier scene, before the cupcakes were eaten, Packer proudly tells the cameras he was never in rehab and spent six hours carefully removing the frosting and layering in both legal and illegal drugs in order to get revenge on the office staff who he believes were responsible for his firing. Everyone is recovering from the effects of the drugs and they tell stories of the incidents that occurred. When people ask Andy what his effects were, he and Kevin start acting very awkward and pretend that nothing happened, as the cameras show clips of them becoming high and performing a number of weird activities such as rubbing each other\\'s faces, trying on each other\\'s clothes, and dancing.\\nFanny realizes how much she misses home and sees that Cameron seems to enjoy the farm life.

First they try a bookstore (where Darryl begins fulfilling his own resolution to \"read more\" by purchasing an e-book reader which he conceals from Dwight and Andy), but later end up at a roller skating rink where they fail to find women (being that the rink is almost completely empty). Dwight skates off to a nearby strip club, Darryl uses his e-book reader and later lies that he was playing in the arcade, and Andy skates around by himself to the music of Dave Matthews Band. They all end up having a great time afterwards, boogieing around the rink underneath its strobe lights.\\nWhen Michael sees no ring on Holly\\'s finger, he is at first ecstatic, and launches into celebration (which includes throwing confetti and dancing to Kelly Clarkson\\'s \"My Life Would Suck Without You\"). When he approaches Holly to talk, however, Holly receives a phone call from A.J., during which she tells him she loves him. Michael finds out later, through Phyllis and Erin, that Holly gave up on the ultimatum, and is still in a relationship with A.J..\\nMichael becomes upset to the point of interrupting Pam\\'s resolution-board meeting to chastise his employees for giving up on their resolutions, taking out his frustration on Kevin by force-feeding him broccoli as well as urging Creed to do a cartwheel. Holly, however, sees the parallel Michael is making between these abandoned resolutions and her own abandoned ultimatum, and leaves the room abruptly, visibly upset.\\nMichael attempts to apologize to Holly, but when she declines to talk, he has her join Kevin and Creed in his office so he can apologize to the two of them, simultaneously apologizing to Holly indirectly. In the end, it is clear that Holly is not that happy and she is caught by the cameras telling A.J. that she wants to take a break from their relationship at least until she returns to Nashua.\\nMeanwhile, the New Year\\'s resolutions get out of hand. Kevin defaces Ryan\\'s resolution by creating the word \"fart\" out of \"art\" (before audibly farting himself), and Ryan snaps back, \"Hey, was it me or you who just shoved the butt-end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?\" Meredith reverts to smoking when she sees Pam\\'s can of soda (her resolution was \"drink less caffeine,\" though Pam states that she\\'s had a lot to deal with today), and Erin unintentionally angers Creed by doing a cartwheel in the middle of the office. Pam decides to toss the resolution board into a dumpster, saying she\\'s learned her lesson.\\nThe episode closes with Michael helping Creed learn how to do a cartwheel, which he performs (poorly).

Thus, he begins telling ridiculous stories. Toby sneakily suggests that they take a break from the session, play some games, and \"talk\" to pass the remaining hours. Oddly enough, Michael lets his guard down and opens up to Toby about his childhood and relationships with people. Through listening to his history, Toby determines that Michael has an inherent need to be liked. Once he realizes what is happening, Michael ends the counseling session, and yells at Toby for duping him. Rather than arguing, Toby gives up and hands Michael the official counseling form, explaining that it has to be sent to corporate. However, this enables Michael to fill out the form any way he wants. In his haste, Michael accidentally indicates on the form that he is severely depressed and homicidal.\\nMeanwhile, Pam realizes that although she has her dream job as a salesman (a position she fought for a few seasons back), she really isn\\'t cut out for it. Since starting the position, she has made few sales, and therefore, very little money. A chance visit from a vendor gives her an idea: if she can finagle her way into being promoted to office administrator, it will probably improve her income. She informs Gabe of her promotion \"from a few months back,\" and tells him that she hasn\\'t been paid accordingly. Gabe promises her he\\'ll get the missing wages if she can get all of the department heads to sign off on it. While she\\'s busy convincing everyone that she has become the new administrator, Gabe catches on that she might be lying, and confronts her about it.

Using tips from the rest of the office to make himself appear more sophisticated, Dwight, with Jim and Andy, return to the shop. It is revealed Dwight came by with beet juice soaked hands, easily confused for human blood, and was refused service on security grounds. The group leaves somewhat embarrassed, but not before Dwight buys what he came here for: a pewter wizard holding a crystal ball.\\nAt the end of the episode, Michael is told that he accidentally indicated he was homicidal by Toby.

Spotting a threesome tossing a Frisbee, he declares something about getting his \"friz on,\" then he runs into the game, snags the disc, and wildly tosses it in a direction where no one is standing.\\nMichael cannot hear Ryan\\'s introduction, wherein Ryan explains how Dunder Mifflin is a dying company. Michael accompanies his entrance with a Brandenburg concerto playing from a boombox and begins his speech by ripping the pages out of a student\\'s expensive textbook. Michael illustrates his description of how to start a business with a series of candy bars, throwing them to the incredulous audience.\\nRyan redirects the speech into a question-and-answer session. Michael solemnly states that \"real business is done on paper,\" and tells the students to write that fact down. The audience quickly complies by typing it on their laptops.\\nThe Q&A session intensifies, with students wondering aloud how a small business could survive against the \"five Goliaths\" of the paper industry. Michael defends his company, commenting at the students\\' inability to understand the situation based upon their age and lack of experience. He also states that the United States faces \"five goliaths\" as well but only states four: Al-Qaeda, Global Warming, sex predators, and mercury poisoning. When a student uses Ryan\\'s prediction of Dunder Mifflin\\'s obsolescence as proof of his point, Michael is shocked to hear that Ryan had made such a statement. He informs the room that Ryan still hasn\\'t made a sale, started a fire in his attempt to make a cheese pita, and \"a lot of people think he\\'s a tease.\" He heads for the exit, shouting, \"Ryan doesn\\'t know anything, and neither do any of you. So suck on that!\"\\nIn the car ride home, Michael tells Ryan to clean out his desk. Ryan has mixed feelings when he learns that he is simply being relocated to the annex... right next to Kelly. Michael then comments to Ryan that \"... a good manager doesn\\'t fire people, he hires people and inspires people... people will never go out of business\". The words of wisdom surprise Ryan. Kelly is ecstatic Ryan is moving to the desk beside her, but he tells her that it\\'s only temporary and tells her not to freak out. Nevertheless, she remains excited.\\nDwight spots animal droppings on the carpet. He peeks above the ceiling tiles and initially concludes that there is a bird stuck in the air vents, but is surprised to discover that it is actually a bat. The bat escapes, and everyone panics (except for Jim, Oscar, and a somewhat amused Creed). Kelly and Meredith scream, Kevin runs into the camera, Pam hides near the coat rack, Karen hides under her desk, and Angela falls flat on the floor and prays. Stanley heads home (with a very dry \"Good-bye\") as Dwight shuts the bat in a conference room. Angela puts on a clear plastic rain bonnet so the bat won\\'t poop on her head.\\nJim calls animal control and tells Dwight that it won\\'t be at the office until 6 p.m. As Jim and Dwight talk, Jim tells Dwight that he doesn\\'t feel good. He tells Dwight he might have been bitten by the bat and implies he might be turning into a vampire. Dwight looks on in confusion. Jim and Karen continue pranking Dwight, speaking in slow, deliberate tones. In one incident, Jim says that Karen\\'s \"ice cold\" slice of garlic bread burns him, and later he claims to be blinded by the bright light reflecting off of Angela\\'s cross.\\nDwight says, if a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense that it came from a \"–sylvania\", like Pennsylvania. He continues by saying Jim may not turn into a vampire but is carrying the vampiric germ. As the day progresses, Dwight teams up with Creed to take down the bat. Kelly protests their attempts to kill it, claiming that it is a living creature with feelings \"and a family.\" Dwight and Creed\\'s first attempt is unsuccessful, as the bat flies out of the conference room and into the break room, whereupon Kelly changes her tune to \"KILL IT!\" as it comes near her. When the day ends, everyone leaves the office, except for Meredith, who is stuck in the women\\'s restroom. Jim leaves as though he\\'s a vampire, shielding himself from the sun with his overcoat. Dwight then charges into the break room with a garbage bag. The bat lands on Meredith\\'s head and Dwight traps the bat in the bag along with Meredith\\'s head. After much struggle, he manages to get the bat off of her.\\nPreviously, in the office, when Pam asks Kelly to come to her art show, Kelly feigns excitement about attending. Toby states that he would like to go, but his daughter has a play that night. In a rare display of emotion, he expresses extreme disappointment at having to miss Pam\\'s show to the point of maligning his daughter, but Pam tells him he should go to the play. At the art show, Roy appears with his brother and gleefully points out the fact that he brought another guest while no one else from Dunder Mifflin had shown up. Roy quickly leaves with his brother and Pam says she\\'ll just drive herself home. Roy asks her to drive to his place. Oscar\\'s boyfriend, Gil, criticizes her work as unimaginative \"motel art\". At the end of the night, Michael arrives and is impressed with her work. He zeroes in on her portrait of the office building and insists on buying it to hang in the office, telling Pam he is proud of her. His words visibly touch Pam, and she hugs him in thanks. Later, he hangs the picture in the office, stating that the portrait would not have been made possible without the use of paper... unless the image had been taken by a camera.\\nThe Season Three DVD contains a number of deleted scenes.

Angela is forced to bring her son, Phillip, to work, after her daycare turns her child away. Dwight, who initially wanted to marry his current girlfriend Esther, begins to think that Angela\\'s son is actually his. He confronts her, but she tells him that this is not the case. Dwight then confers with Jim, who tells Dwight that if he truly loves Angela then that\\'s who he should pursue. Dwight makes up his mind and proposes to Angela, who says yes. Angela finally reveals to Dwight that Phillip is indeed his son.\\nMeanwhile, Darryl returns to Scranton, after quietly quitting a week ago to work full-time at Athlead, the sports marketing company that Jim founded. When the others spot him, they are upset that he left without saying goodbye and demand to spend some time with him one way or another before he leaves for good. The office ultimately decides on one final dance together.\\nWhen Darryl runs into Pam, he tells her about Athlead\\'s success and how Jim is missing out by staying in Scranton. Pam begins to worry that she is making Jim do something that he does not want to do. She later confronts her husband and admits that she thinks she might not be enough for him; he tries to tell her that she is the most important thing in his life. Later, he decides to get the documentary crew\\'s help; the crew makes a DVD of many of the highlights of Jim and Pam\\'s relationship throughout the series. The final scene is from the second season Christmas episode \"Christmas Party\" in which Jim gives Pam a teapot as a gift, but takes back his very emotional note that expresses his feelings for Pam before she notices it. After the DVD plays, Jim presents Pam with the actual, unopened note. She reads it, and the two happily embrace.\\nMeanwhile, Andy auditions for America\\'s Next A Cappella Sensation. Andy meets an exuberant and like-minded lady, Casey Dean from Cincinnati, Ohio. However, before he is able to tryout in front of the judges—who include Aaron Rodgers, Clay Aiken, and Santigold—the auditions close, and Andy makes a fool of himself. Dejected, he journeys to Poor Richard\\'s Pub, where he meets up with the rest of his former office workers. Altogether, the office watches the official airing of the documentary on PBS\\' Scranton affiliate station, WVIA-TV. As the office workers stare at the screen, the the opening dialogue from the series\\' first episode, \"Pilot\", begins.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/9_22_and_23_A.A.R.M..md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/9_7_The_Whale.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Andy and the rest of the office staff talk through Skype.

Darryl then tells the cameras Andy has only been sailing for two days.\\nDavid Wallace calls to tell the branch that a massive client, Scranton White Pages, a phone book company, has recently dropped their paper supplier of 10 years and is now interested in Dunder Mifflin. Dwight brags that David has selected him to go after this \"white whale\" of a client instead of Jim, but David says he wants Jim on the call too. Dwight tries to take the phone off speaker, to keep Jim from being included, but Jim unplugs the handset and puts it in his desk drawer. When David tells Dwight that the new CEO is a woman, the women of the office begin to worry as Dwight is horrible when it comes to female clients. Pam asks Jim if he can go instead, but he can\\'t due to a conference call for the company he and his friends are working on.

The two agree to stake him out.\\nPam tries to teach Dwight how to be respectful to women and teaches him ways to indicate that he is listening such as smiling and nodding, but Dwight appears creepy when doing so. Nellie and Phyllis try to help him, but they soon deem him \"hopeless\". Pam agrees to go on the sales pitch with Dwight and try to help him.\\nMeanwhile, Jim calls his friends to discuss the investment and is embarrassed to learn that he is the only one calling and all the others are actually there. He tries to talk to them through his office phone, but various distractions around the office prevent Jim from focusing.\\nOscar and Angela spy on the Senator and while Oscar is relieved to know that Blake is a woman, Angela becomes jealous. However, it is revealed that Blake has a boyfriend letting Angela relax, but Oscar becomes jealous when he notices another man and the Senator getting along quite nicely.\\nDwight and Pam arrive at the White Pages office and they soon realize that the CEO is Jan Levinson. Pam tells Dwight to forget all they had taught him. Jan arrives and becomes furious when she realizes that Dwight and Pam are the sales representatives as she was expecting David Wallace. She had wanted to show David how powerful she had become and never planned to do business with Dunder Mifflin at all. Dwight, however, still intends to land this massive client and he tells Pam to stall before leaving the room.\\nToby enjoys spending time with the other men in the office as he feels he is really bonding with them. Meanwhile, Pete jokes around with Erin about his mustache and when it\\'s obvious that Erin thinks it\\'s ugly, Pete shaves it off.\\nAngela begins to get suspicious as to why Oscar is so focused on the Senator. Before Oscar can leave, they watch the Senator make a phone call and when Oscar\\'s phone starts to ring, he looks up to an angry and terrifying-looking Angela.\\nJim tries to talk to the other investors in the parking lot, but a loud saw across the street causes him to go to a quieter area and he accidentally sets off Meredith\\'s car alarm. Hank then comes out believing that the local skateboard punks are back and yells for them to come out. Meredith also comes out, believing that someone is breaking into her car, causing even more chaos and noise for Jim.\\nPam is forced to watch a very awkward and weird slideshow of Astrid with Jan\\'s singing.

Jim asks what that means.\\nOn the way out of the building, Dwight and Pam convince Jan\\'s emotional and low self-esteemed secretary, Molly, that she should quit as Jan is likely to fire her anyway. She appears to like Dwight as he seems empathetic to her problems. Pam encourages Dwight to get her number, to which Dwight replies he already got \"it\", referring to her license plate number, and that this is all he needs to get her phone number.

To improve efficiency, he installs a \"doomsday device\" that will send incriminating emails to Robert if they make five mistakes in one day, effectively causing them to lose their jobs. After only one day, however, the group manages to make five mistakes, and Dwight reveals that the emails will be automatically sent to Robert at 5:00 pm. Andy pleads with Dwight to deactivate the machine, but Dwight refuses, belittles the rest of the office staff for being so careless, and retreats to Schrute Farms.\\nAfter Dwight abandons the group, Andy tasks Pam, Erin, and Kevin\\xa0to try and change Dwight\\'s mind. The group find Dwight digging a horse grave and offer to help him out. Andy tries to talk to Dwight about deactivating the machine, but Pam consistently quiets him, saying she knows Dwight will come to understand if they aren\\'t pushing it. After complimenting Dwight numerous times and having a small meal, Pam makes a joke that emphasizes that everyone is human and makes mistakes. Dwight, after hearing this, deactivates the machine after the party leaves Schrute Farms.

Gabe believes that he and Val have a connection, and constantly pursues and tries to impress her throughout the day. Darryl, observing Gabe\\'s pitiful attempts, tries to imply that Val doesn\\'t feel the same way, but to no avail. When Gabe does ask Val out, she politely declines and says she does not date co-workers at all.

Kevin details a very basic idea he has about cookie placement in the vending machine, but Robert gets the impression that he is extremely clever and is speaking only in metaphors. Ryan later tricks Kevin into explaining an idea he has involving the Big Mac, and Robert realizes that there was no subtext to Kevin\\'s ideas.\\nMeanwhile, at Gettysburg, Andy is unhappy with the lack of morale and belief in his leadership and attempts to make an analogy between running a paper company and fighting in the Civil War. Andy starts to lead a haphazard tour, and eventually most of office members sit down to rest. Jim and Darryl follow Andy after he presses on, and eventually tell him to stop trying to impress the office. They reinforce the fact that his co-workers like him the way he is.\\nDuring the tour, Dwight argues with Oscar about what he claims is the northernmost battle of the Civil War: the Battle of Schrute Farms. Dwight maintains that its absence from the history books is an example of rewriting history, whereas Oscar maintains that the battle is a fictitious creation. After tracking down a historian, Dwight and Oscar learn that the Battle of Schrute Farms did in fact take place. However, the \"battle\" was really a code term. During the Civil War, Schrute Farms was a safe haven for artists and poets (and, as heavily implied, homosexuals).

Jim tries to convince Michael to give Pam a different award this year.\\nThe awards begin with Michael attempting to perform a rap, but he can\\'t keep up with the lyrics. Oscars sums up the Dundies \"as like a kid\\'s birthday party, where there\\'s nothing for you to do, but the kid\\'s having a good time.\" As everyone prepares to order, Michael tells them they have to pay for their meals and drinks. Michael\\'s jokes fall flat; Dwight\\'s contributions also are not helpful. Darryl and Roy, concluding that the awards are lame, leave early, taking Pam with them.

Kelly and Ryan play Dance Dance Revolution. Erin and Andy want to play it, but decide that playing together would make people aware of their relationship. While Isabel and Dwight talk and flirt with each other, Angela follows them, leading him to get closer to Isabel while they play whac-a-mole.

Kevin is given the job of shredding the company documents from Stamford, which he relishes. As he demonstrates the power of his shredder from Staples, Kevin gets carried away and accidentally shreds his credit card.

Pam is sitting at her desk fascinated by their semi-awkward conversation. Michael admits during a talking head that he is fond of Andy and thinks he has a likable way about him. Jim walks in the door, and Pam is obviously extremely smitten to see him since she hasn\\'t seen him in a long time, and still has feelings for him. Meanwhile, Dwight instructs Jim not to mess with him, as he is older and wiser. Jim gapes at Dwight\\'s forehead, freaking him out.\\nDwight introduces himself to Andy and each man believes the other shall report to him in the office hierarchy. Andy mentions his title contains the word \\'director\\' which outranks a \\'manager\\' on a film set and questions Dwight if he knows anything about film.

When informed she eats beef, he says to treat it like poisoned beef, because the snacks are for guests. In a familiar manner, Karen gives Jim a stick of gum and Pam notices. Michael plays a videotape he has created called \"Lazy Scranton\" featuring himself and Dwight rhyming over the music of Saturday Night Live\\'s \"Lazy Sunday\". Jim says the video treat reminds him of his orientation film: \"The Scranton Witch Project.\" The viewer is shown a brief clip of that film, which features Michael illuminated by a flashlight saying he \"gets so scared when people don\\'t label their personal food.\" While it is clear that everyone is bored, Michael says that he thought the video would be an \"A\" or an \"A+\"; then, he remembered that there is an \"A++\".\\nIn the coffee room, Pam notes that Jim has purchased a bottle of water from the vending machine instead of grape soda that he used to frequently purchase while at Scranton. Jim simply replies \"I\\'m evolving, Pam.\" which to note, his sleeves are buttoned up.

Jim replies not tonight since he is still settling in and then Michael walks in the room, making things more awkward.\\nIn a series of vignettes, Stamford transplants are distracted by their new Scranton coworkers: Ryan by Hannah\\'s open use of a breast pump; Karen by Phyllis\\'s perfume from metropolitan Orlando; Martin by Creed\\'s feet-up, boisterous phone conversation. In an interview, Stanley questions the audacity of \"these new people\" and mentions he\\'s silently sat downwind from Phyllis\\'s stinky perfume for years.\\nThe integration portion of Michael\\'s orientation finds four new employees sitting in chairs on the banquet room table. Karen asks Michael why they aren\\'t being treated as equal. The boss and Dwight try to force hefty, skeptical Tony up on the table, and he quits instead. Jan later calls Michael and yells at him for firing Tony when he tried to quit (an impulsive decision Michael made after feeling insulted by Tony\\'s attempt). She complains that because Michael fired Tony rather than letting him quit like he wanted to, Dunder Mifflin has to pay him severance. Michael initially uses Dwight as a scapegoat by saying \"Bad advice from my number two.\" of which Jan corrects him and says Jim is actually going to be the number two. This is eventually brought into a meeting between Michael, Dwight, Jim and Andy and culminates in yet another battle between Dwight and Andy for Michael\\'s respect.\\nAfter Tony leaves the room, Hannah walks out, agreeing Michael is unprofessional. A short while later, Michael runs into the office and tells everyone to go down to the parking lot because someone has let the air out of all their tires. The employees rush down to see what is going on and Michael blames Vance Refrigeration employees. Michael suggests stealing all of the refrigerators from Bob Vance in retribution. Martin notes Michael\\'s tires remain fully inflated, but Michael says they left a hate note under his windshield wiper reading, \"You guys suck! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you suck!\" Everyone shakes their heads in disbelief at what Michael has done. Once again, Pam noticed Karen casually touching Jim\\'s back with her hand as they walk away. Later, all the employees are shown talking to each other and getting along due to a common interest: Michael as an unprofessional boss. Michael watches from his office and comments how a common enemy has brought the Stamford and Scranton employees together, although he apparently believes that the employees have fallen for his scheme and consider Vance Refrigeration the common enemy, not Michael himself.\\nJim sits in his Toyota Corolla and receives a call from Karen to meet up. He quickly ends the conversation as he sees Pam and runs over to say the day had been awkward and that he feels he should tell her he is seeing someone. She denies awkwardness and states that they\\'ll always be friends.\\nKevin uses the shredder to make a salad. Dwight and Andy trade numerous barbs on a downward elevator ride.

Michael is still upset that he was not cast in the play and refuses to go, but relents when Andy claims no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got the part, the part went to an established actor instead. Ultimately though, Erin doesn\\'t show up either, as she agreed to babysit Cece for Jim and Pam so they could come instead.\\nThe cast of Sweeney ToddOn the night of the show, everything starts off smoothly. Jim and Pam are caught sitting in another couples\\' seats and are asked to return to their original seats, which are revealed to be next to Michael. Darryl informs Michael the lead role is his plumber (who did not even audition), which irritates Michael a great deal since his only solace for not getting the part was Andy\\'s claim that an established actor was cast instead. During intermission, the director of the play encourages Michael to keep coming back to audition for his shows, which further irritates Michael. He decides to swipe a bottle of wine from the concession table. During the second act, Michael, Meredith, Darryl, and Kevin are seen drinking the wine Michael stole, though Michael intended to have all the wine to himself. Andy constantly checks his phone, mid play, for messages from Erin but doesn\\'t get any. While he is on stage, his phone goes off in his pocket, causing him and the actor playing Sweeney Todd to break character after being unable to improvise, much to Michael\\'s delight.\\nTo make matters worse, Michael drops the now empty bottle of wine, which causes a commotion as it starts rolling underneath the seats towards the stage. The balloons that Michael brought also escape his grip and pop as they reach the ceiling. This then causes a baby to cry, and Pam comments the baby sounds like Cece. As she looks back, she sees Erin standing in the back with Cece, exciting Andy, but angering Pam and Jim who leave deciding to never leave the house together again. At the end of the show everyone cheers the actor playing Sweeney Todd, but Michael angrily boos him. The actor later confronts Michael at the cast party after being congratulated by him. Darryl teaches Michael a lesson by booing him shortly after the actor leaves the conversation, which Michael states \"I don\\'t like that. At all.\"\\nMeanwhile, Dwight and Angela continue to see each other for their procreation sessions as their contract dictates. Angela hints that she\\'s trying to win Dwight back during a talking head interview. It is subtly implied that Dwight is slowly falling for Angela again, despite his denial to the camera. During the show she purposely places gum on her dress, giving her an excuse to change into more casual but tight-fitting clothing that one would wear while working on a farm in an attempt to seduce Dwight. Dwight seems to ignore the change of clothing but is seen checking her out during the intermission. As Angela leaves, Dwight tries to make love with her, but Angela has second thoughts and wants to go home. She decides to count the night as one of their \\'sessions\\' anyway.\\nAndy and Erin spend some time together backstage, where they \"murder\" each other with the prop razor blades. While Andy shows Erin her potential seats for the evening, she states how happy she is that they\\'re hanging out outside the office. Sadly, the moment ends when Gabe calls Erin and she has to leave. As a sad Andy sulks backstage, the rest of the office converges on him and cheers him up by complimenting his performance. At the request of his co-workers, Andy sings them another song (Macy Gray\\'s \"I Try\"), as Angela drives home with a smile, Jim and Pam sip Irish Cream with orange juice, and Dwight casually sings along.\\nThe last scene is Michael\\'s audition for the play, where he acts out an entire episode of Law & Order.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/7_3_Andy%27s_Play.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/4_12_The_Deposition.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Jan and Michael drive to the corporate office in New York City to do a deposition for Jan\\'s lawsuit over her dismissal. They rehearse Michael\\'s testimony in the car, and he makes up absurd mnemonic devices so he won\\'t forget what to say. He has also memorized Jan\\'s answers and plans to throw in some \"errs\" and \"ahhs\" for the deposition to appear not so scripted.\\nMeanwhile, back at the warehouse, Darryl is wiping Jim out in a table tennis game while Pam and Kelly watch. Kelly goes all trash talk on Pam, about how Pam\\'s boyfriend \"sucks\" at ping pong, but Kelly calls it \"talking smack.\" Pam gets ticked off and sets up a practice ping pong table in the conference room so she can get back at Kelly by way of Jim beating Darryl. She gets Kevin and then Dwight as \"sparring partners\" for Jim, but Dwight easily defeats Jim. Dwight reveals for the first time that he is a huge lifelong table tennis fan, and he reels off the names of immortals of the sport whom he idolizes. When the match finally comes, Jim has improved, but every time Darryl scores a point, Kelly verbally assaults his and Pam\\'s ego. Finally, Pam has enough and challenges Kelly to a match. Both seem to be horrid at table tennis and aren\\'t even able to bop the balls over the net. After a few rounds of this, Jim and Darryl are bored and traipse upstairs for the conference room ping-pong table.\\nAt corporate, Michael is (maybe) all set to support Jan during the deposition hearing, but Ryan then takes him aside and urges him to do the right thing and not hurt Dunder Mifflin. Michael agrees and then is left with a terrible conflict. Michael\\'s testimony starts well when he mentions the inappropriate way corporate handled Jan\\'s situation, but his comments about her drinking and about apparent conflicts in statements he made about the nature of their relationship and when it started to cause problems.\\nWhen he finds out that Jan has stolen his diary in order to prove the timeline of their relationship, Michael is extremely upset. Jan points out that he emailed a topless photo of her to the entire company, and though they agree that fair is fair, their \"Love you\" remarks are a bit cold.\\xa0Toby tries to comfort Michael in the lunchroom, but Michael instead trashes Toby\\'s lunch tray and leaves.\\nThen, to add insult to injury for the second segment of the deposition, Dunder Mifflin\\'s attorney reveals to Michael that Jan gave him a scathing performance review after they had begun dating. In it, she argued\\xa0that Michael\\xa0is\\xa0an unmanageable employee and unfit for his position as branch manager, and should be demoted.\\nIn a last-ditch attempt to win\\xa0Michael back to her side, Jan has her lawyer read the deposition of\\xa0David Wallace. From it, Michael,\\xa0who always felt that he was a front-runner for the job at Corporate, learns that Wallace\\xa0reluctantly admitted that,\\xa0while Michael is a nice guy, he was never a serious contender for the job.\\nBut David has shown more consideration to Michael than Jan so, when asked if he believes Dunder Mifflin really showed a pattern of mistreatment to Jan, Michael declares that it did not. He does not hold David\\'s words against him, stating \"You expect to get screwed by your company. But you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.\"\\nMichael and Jan drive home, clearly angry at each other. Jan suggests they pick up some Chinese food. Michael states he\\'d prefer something cheap, and Jan replies that Chinese is cheap.

He originally enlists Jim to be one of the guest speakers, but Jim abruptly pulls out when he sees one of the audience members and quickly leaves. Seeing Jim leave and thinking the idea has failed, the other speakers (Dwight, Phyllis and Stanley) also pull out leaving Andy to replace them with Kevin, Creed and Ryan. Kevin\\'s speech goes badly when he gets ill from running around the room and vomits in front of the audience. Kelly, who replaces Ryan, makes things slightly better when she calls up an old professor from her management training time at Yale (whom she may have slept with) to talk business lessons, but Creed ruins it when he goes into a speech about the Loch Ness Monster.\\nIn an attempt to help Andy with his seminar, Michael has taken a Greek persona of \"Mykonos\". After noting that he sounds more Italian than Greek, Holly spends the day helping Michael develop his character. While trying out his character on Hank, Holly creates her own persona as \"Necropolis\", \"Mykonos\\'s\" wife. The two attend the seminar in character as husband and wife, and in a talking head, until Michael professes his love for her while in character and she decides to go back to work.\\nMeanwhile, Erin is trying to beat Gabe in a game of Scrabble. Unfortunately, she\\'s not very good, and the winner of their Scrabble games always picks the movie they watch. Since Gabe has already subjected her to numerous horror movies such as The Shining, Rosemary\\'s Baby and The Ring, Erin desperately needs a win. With the help of Oscar and Pam, she almost beats Gabe but loses on the last turn, because she doesn\\'t realize Oscar is trying to feed her a winning word (\"apoplexy\") and instead puts in the word \"ape\".\\nAfter Jim spends all day outside of the office, Pam forces him to tell the camera crew why he\\'s avoiding the guy\\xa0(Tom Witochkin) he saw at the seminar. He and the man were friends in third-grade who were placed in separate reading groups in school (Jim was in the higher-level one). After his mother told him to hang out with his \"smart\" friends, Jim told Tom that \"mom says you\\'re too dumb to hang out with.\" Jim eventually bumps into him\\xa0in the break room, and tries to laugh off their history, but Tom\\xa0mocks Jim for not being as successful as his superior intellect would have indicated, and snarks \"Where\\'s your jet pack, Zuckerberg?\"\\nBack at Andy\\'s seminar, Dwight talks to one of the attendees, a man who owns a golf supply business, and realizes that this could actually be a good opportunity for the sales team. He, along with Phyllis and Stanley, try to rejoin Andy, who refuses at Darryl\\'s prompting. At the end of the seminar, Andy is able to sell three packages, thanks to the advice of Michael.\\nAt the end of the day, Gabe shows Erin the movie they\\'ll be watching that night, Hardware, which involves a killer robot (calling it a compromise because Erin wanted to watch WALL-E).

Michael and Jan are still living together, although she apparently puts little effort into the relationship and is usually still asleep when Michael leaves for work. Jim confirms that he broke up with Karen in New York. He says she insisted that she would continue working in Scranton, but disappeared immediately afterward. Jim and Pam indicate that they have been seeing each other socially, but only as friends. Kevin insists that they\\'re secretly dating, since they seem so happy. He even comes up with a nickname for them: \"PB&J\" which stands for \"Pam Beesly and Jim.\"\\nAs he arrives at work, Michael accidentally hits Meredith with his car, sending her to the hospital for a fractured pelvis. This event alarms the rest of the office, and especially Michael\\'s new direct superior Ryan, who is concerned about a lawsuit. As Meredith\\'s coworkers make plans to visit her, Michael takes over, insisting they should all go together en masse on their lunch break. Angela bows out at first in order to attend to the intense medical regimen of her ailing cat, Sprinkles. Pam insists that Angela, as head of the Party Planning Committee, has a responsibility to be part of the visit. Dwight agrees to care for the cat in her place. Meanwhile, Pam\\'s computer gets a virus necessitating the technical support employee, Sadiq to be called in; it is revealed she got the virus while trying to buy a celebrity sex tape.\\nThe visit to the hospital is awkward, as Michael tries to extract forgiveness from Meredith, and Creed quizzes her about the pain killers she is taking. Upon the group\\'s return to the office, Dwight unceremoniously informs Angela that her cat is dead, but is now \"in a better place\" (specifically, Angela\\'s freezer).\\nThe combination of Meredith\\'s accident, Sprinkles\\' death, and the virus on Pam\\'s computer convinces Michael that the office is cursed. He convenes a meeting to determine the cause, where he demands to know everyone\\'s religious beliefs. Michael ultimately comes to the conclusion that \"God is dead.\" Blaming Toby for the \"curse,\" he orders research into mythical animals to which they could offer a sacrifice.\\nDwight discovers during his own courtesy visit to the hospital that Meredith has had a precautionary rabies shot due to several recent animal bites (including a bat bite caused by Dwight himself). He informs Michael, who immediately takes credit for saving Meredith\\'s life by sending her to the hospital. With that bit of good news, he decides the curse is over.\\nKevin spies in the parking lot to see whether Jim and Pam are secretly getting together outside the office. He is disappointed to find no evidence, but the camera crew discovers Pam pulling over to a curb a block away and picking up Jim. They kiss and drive away.\\nJim and Pam privately are shown the footage of them taken at the end of Part One. They lamely deny a relationship at first, but Pam finally gives up and acknowledges they are dating. Both confirm things are going well, although they seem to have no immediate intention of telling the rest of the office.\\nMichael is still feeling guilty about hurting Meredith, so he decides to lead a charity 5K fun run, entitled \"Michael Scott\\'s Dunder Mifflin Scranton Meredith Palmer Memorial Celebrity Rabies Awareness Pro-Am Fun Run Race for the Cure\" in an attempt to bring awareness to the dangers of rabies. The staff is mostly unsuccessful in getting donations, and nearly all of the $700 raised was donated by Jan (who is actually just donating Michael\\'s money since she is now unemployed). Michael decides to spend $200 of that money on an oversized check, which he wants to present to a \"rabies doctor.\"\\nPam inadvertently walks in on Michael while he is changing for the race, even though Michael had said \"Come in\" in response to her knock on the door. Michael attempts to defend himself: \"European offices are naked all the time.\" In a talking head interview, Pam rejects the advice that if nervous during public speaking one should picture the listeners naked.\\nMichael insists that everyone in the office participate in the 5K, although few take it seriously. Stanley, Creed, and Oscar take a taxi to grab some beers, returning to the race just feet from the finish line. Jim and Pam mostly walk, hand-in-hand, stopping at an estate sale where Pam buys a lamp. Kevin is quickly drenched in sweat because he forgot to bring running clothes, while Andy suffers from extremely irritated nipples.\\nAlong the way, Angela confronts Dwight with her suspicion that Sprinkles had been deliberately killed. To her surprise, Dwight acknowledges doing so, saying his \"farm\" attitude is that any animal that is suffering (and cannot pull its own weight) should be put down. Angela is furious, saying that being euthanized prevents Sprinkles from being in \"cat heaven.\"\\nToby ends up finishing first thanks to some inadvertent help from Dwight (who slipped Toby Imodium instead of laxatives). His joy is short-lived as he learns that the course Michael created was not circular, leaving everyone five kilometers from the office.\\nMichael, who had decided to \"carbo-load\" on fettuccine alfredo and abstain from water, quickly becomes ill, but is convinced by Jim and Pam to continue. He considers reaching the finish line a major accomplishment, and is given Pam\\'s lamp as a trophy.\\nMichael\\'s poor dietary choice puts him in the hospital for dehydration, where he is visited by Meredith.

When Michael brings all the guys into a circle next to the conference room and makes a lot of noise, Jan tells them to go somewhere else. Dwight suggests the warehouse and Jan heartily approves.\\nJan continues by asking the women to state something they are good at. Meredith starts to say her name and that she\\'s an alcoholic, but catches herself and says she\\'s good at supplier relations. Phyllis believes she\\'s good with computers until Angela criticizes her work. They move on to goals. Meredith wants to be five years sober in five years. Jan starts to praise Kelly who doesn\\'t want to be lugging kids around in mini-van. Then Kelly says she wants an SUV. Pam admits she wants a house with a terrace on it and to be in a loving marriage with Roy. But she has always wanted to do something with art. After Phyllis compliments her work, Jan mentions a graphic design class offered by Corporate. She\\'d have to spend a few weeks in New York, but really only a few weekends after that. Pam starts to defer, but Jan reminds her that there are always a million reasons not to do something. Jan explains to the camera that her intent here is to find out if there are any women here who would make a good addition to Corporate.\\nDownstairs, Michael starts to talk about how hard the warehouse staff works. This is awkward for two reasons. First of all, Darryl and his crew are not thrilled to have Michael there as he refuses to stay off the machinery. His recklessness behind the controls causes several supply shelves to come crashing down. Secondly, Jim isn\\'t keen on being around Roy who has probably heard the rumor about him liking Pam. Kevin offers to back Jim up if it comes to blows. It turns out that Roy is fine with it. He believes it was a long time ago and that Jim and Pam are just friends. Besides, it gives Pam someone to talk to so she can get it all out before she comes home.\\nJan addresses how one should dress for the job one wants and not the job one has. Angela doesn\\'t think she\\'s getting anything out of this. Besides, Jan\\'s clothes clearly indicate that she wants to be a whore.\\nMichael sits down the guys for a gripe session about women. It quickly derails into a comparison between the office and warehouse workers. Darryl thinks that\\'s the biggest issue. Michael may think they\\'re all the same, but they\\'re not. If they had a union, they could compete economically with the office. Michael is unable to tone down the union rhetoric.\\nWhile Jan attempts to discuss how sports analogies often leave women out, Kelly uses the opportunity to ask about \"getting to second base\" in the context of Jan\\'s relationship with Michael. Michael interrupts to explain about the union problem. Jan tells him he has to handle it himself.

He attempts to insert their history into the conversation and she tells him in no uncertain terms they are not discussing it and makes him leave.\\nThe women continue to grill Jan about her relationship with Michael until she calls for a break.\\nDuring the break, Pam tells Jim about the opportunity in New York. She seems excited about it; Jim believes she should go for it.\\nThe other men are trying to load up a delivery truck. Ryan comes up with an idea of speeding up the process to which Stanley immediately replies, \"This is a run out the clock situation.\" Michael blows packing peanuts all over the warehouse, pretending it\\'s snow.\\nAt that point, Jan arrives, asks Michael if he\\'s handled the problem, then immediately calls for everyone\\'s attention. She explains clearly that any hint of unionizing will result in the closure of the branch, just like what happened in Pittsfield. They can direct any further questions to Michael...who is hiding.\\nPam and Roy have an argument about the design class. Jim confirms that she\\'s not going to go after all. She says Roy doesn\\'t believe there\\'s any guarantee it will go anywhere. Jim tells her she has to take a chance on something, unless she wants to be a receptionist for the rest of her life. Pam snaps that she\\'s fine with her choices.\\nThe boys eating pizza in the warehouseTo the camera, she explains that she read about the house with a terrace when she was a kid and thought it was neat. It was just a story that stuck with her. It doesn\\'t have any bearing on her life now. They don\\'t even make houses like that in Scranton. She stops, finally vocalizing that she will never get to live her dream and bursts into tears.\\nMichael treats the men to pizza as some form of compensation. As the day comes to a close, the warehouse is in complete disarray (furthered by Michael trying to create snow by spilling out the foam popcorn in front of a fan), and as Michael and the office employees depart, Darryl shouts: \"Hey Michael, this ain\\'t over!\" as he stands in the middle of a complete mess. Michael shuts the door without responding.\\nThe Season Two DVD contained a number of deleted scenes from this episode.

Dwight then tells the camera that there are ways to tell if someone is lying but you must speak face-to-face, and since Dwight talked to Oscar over the phone, he cannot tell. Next, Michael continues to talk to Jim, but Dwight interrupts and asks what the secret is. Michael then lies to Dwight, doing everything on Dwight's list of ways to determine if someone is lying. Michael takes Jim to Hooters, and wants to talk about Pam. Dwight talks to Pam about Oscar's sick phone call. He asks about Oscar's sniffling, and rummages through all of the jelly beans, taking the remaining black ones, forcing Pam to throw the remainder out.

Michael feels indifferent about the matter, so both sides try to win him over with psychology: Jim and Oscar take Michael out for lunch, while Pam puts on make-up and flirts with him.\\nMeanwhile, Angela and Andy visit Schrute Farms to discuss their wedding plans with Dwight. Dwight holds a mock wedding in a barn, with Dwight playing Andy and Andy playing Angela\\'s father. A Mennonite minister who only speaks German is the minister and performs the mock-ceremony. Dwight goes through the steps of the wedding, putting a ring made of twine on Angela\\'s finger and having them both say \"I do\" to each other. Angela appears to be very happy with Dwight and tells him that she made a mistake getting together with Andy. Dwight acknowledges her mistake and tells her that the mock wedding was real: The minister was performing the real marriage ceremony in German, and Andy acted as their witness. He tells her that this was why he allowed her to have her wedding to Andy on his farm, and she angrily storms off. Back in the office, Angela passionately kisses Andy in front of everybody and tells him that she is going into town to take care of a \"legal issue\" (presumably annulling her marriage to Dwight).\\nMichael still remains indifferent regarding what to buy, so he brings in a third party: Hank the security guard. However, Hank is more interested in staying in the warm office than making a decision so Michael calls CFO David Wallace to help settle the matter. David informs Michael that he has the option of turning in the surplus, which would result in him getting paid a bonus equal to 15% of the amount. Michael then tells the employees that he is not going to replace the copier nor the chairs, but Oscar tricks Michael into revealing that he knows about the third option: Oscar asks him what 15% of 4300 is, and Michael answers \"645 dollars\" instead of just 645.\\nMichael becomes indecisive again and, unable to take the employees\\' intrusive behavior anymore, delegates the decision-making to them, hoping that they will be unable to come to a consensus so that he can take the bonus. The employees quickly decide to have the chairs replaced instead of having nothing replaced. Michael is upset because he already bought a fur coat with the anticipated bonus, and because a group of people threw a bucket of fake blood on his coat when he walked out of the store. Throughout the day, Jim and Pam try to get each other to switch sides. Pam gives Jim a scare, implying that he should switch to her side. Jim later shudders in a talking head spot, amazed at Pam\\'s ultimatum. At the end of the episode, Jim gets back at Pam for getting the chairs replaced by having her make three copies of a document on the copier, initially telling her he is kidding.

Dwight realizes that Andy is attracted to Erin, and admits that he is too. However, Andy and Dwight agree to not pursue a relationship with Erin, and instead continue to be friends.\\nCharles asks Jim to create a “run-down” of his clients. Jim accepts the task, but doesn\\'t know what a run-down is. He stalls, and asks Charles about a run-down and awkwardly talks to him. Hours later, still unknowing of what a run-down is, Jim asks Oscar and Kevin for help, but they are unaware as well. Charles asks Jim if he has started the run-down, but becomes angry when he discovers Jim is doing something else. When Jim finally brings the run-down to Charles, he is told to send it to everyone on the “distribution list”.

The plan inevitably works as the new couple's past relationship issues surface with Gabe making several uncomfortable remarks, and Alice bringing up Pete's immature past, prompting arguments to break out in the conference room. Andy smugly tells the camera that seeing Erin and Pete unhappy makes him feel better.\\nPam interviews for a job in Philadelphia, where she is amused to find her potential manager, Mark, reminiscent of her former Dunder Mifflin regional manager Michael Scott. When Pam realizes that she is simply interviewing for a glorified receptionist's job, she turns down the offer. Pam later tells Jim, during a romantic dinner, that she does not really want to move to Philadelphia, despite Jim having started his own business. Pam's admission leaves their conversation in awkward silence.\\nDwight acquires the help of Angela in order to give his elderly Aunt Shirley a bath.

The coupons contain offers that total $15,000 in savings. This leads the staff (except for Oscar, who does not participate) to believe that the coupon book is literally worth $15,000. Of course, this still isn\\'t enough to convince Jim to wear a matching couples costume (Popeye) with Pam (Olive Oyl). As the day goes on, several people realize their costume might not win, so they leave the office to switch into something more recognizable or provocative.\\nGabe, dressed up as Lady Gaga, informs the staff of a sales idea being implemented where delivery drivers can suggest additional products for the customers they deliver to. The idea is designed to increase overall sales for the company. Michael realizes the idea sounds similar to a suggestion made by\\xa0Darryl a long time ago; Michael, however, initially shot down the idea, believing it wouldn\\'t work. When Jim informs Michael that warehouse worker Madge has made her first sale, Michael decides to confront corporate about stealing Darryl\\'s idea. It is then revealed that Darryl actually pitched the idea to Gabe, who sent it up to corporate, and has already received credit.\\nNew salesman Danny invites everyone to a Halloween party at his bar after work. Almost everyone in the office is aware that Danny and Pam had a two-date fling four years ago. Kevin (dressed as Michael Moore) and Andy (Bill Compton) start a false rumor that Pam and Jim don\\'t want people going to Danny\\'s party, which prompts Danny to confront Jim and Pam in order to determine the validity of the rumor. The conversation quickly turns to Pam and Danny\\'s dating history, and while the three initially laugh about how their coworkers have been exaggerating its significance, it soon becomes clear that both Jim and Pam want to know exactly why she was rejected. Danny tells Jim he didn\\'t call back because Pam couldn\\'t stop talking about Jim during their dates, but when Pam reveals she never mentioned Jim, Danny admits that he found her too \"dorky.\" At the end of the episode, Jim comes into the office wearing his Popeye costume, carrying Cece (dressed as Swee\\'Pea), much to the delight of Pam.\\nMichael becomes progressively more agitated over the fact that Darryl went over his head and tries to get Darryl to apologize in front of everyone for \\'backstabbing\\' him. Darryl refuses, criticizing Michael\\'s poor judgment of his idea. In anger, Michael changes his outfit to Darryl\\'s warehouse uniform and tries to rally the office behind him in declaring Darryl a backstabber. The two bring their argument to Gabe, where Darryl expresses his opinion that Michael has never done anything for him: Ed Truck hired him, Jo Bennett promoted him, and Gabe listened to him, whereas Michael always said no and kept him at the same position for years.

Angela states her opposition to Movie Monday and indeed is the only staffer not in attendance when Jan pops into the branch unexpectedly. Jan scolds Michael despite his explanation that productivity increases following the screenings as employees must work harder due to the lost time.\\nIn interviews, Angela and Dwight both note that Jan seems to have a vendetta against Michael for his choosing Carol over her, and fear it might affect the prospects of the Scranton branch. Angela summons Dwight to the breakroom, where they speak in their traditional manner with their back to each other. Angela tells Dwight she fears for their jobs under Michael\\'s leadership and tells Dwight to speak to Jan about taking over the branch. In the parking lot, Dwight reaches Jan on her cell phone one hour out of Scranton. She does not want to speak but listens when he says it concerns Michael. Dwight instructs her to shop at the nearby Liz Claiborne outlet store — which he has determined to be a favorite brand of hers — until he can reach her. In order to leave, he tells Michael he is visiting a new dentist who works far away, so he will be gone for about three hours.\\nJan and Dwight sit at a nearby diner where he orders two plates of waffles and begins to propose taking over the branch. Pouring syrup maniacally and proceeding to eat in a deliberate way for effect, he states that he could do the job better by firing half the staff, to whom he swears no loyalty since he doesn\\'t care about any of his co-workers. As the meeting ends and Dwight sloppily devours his meal in front of her, he urges Jan to check out a new Ann Taylor outlet store nearby, as he has noticed that she is fond of the brand\\'s earrings. Jan calls Michael, relays the entire meeting and demands he gets his branch under control.\\nMeanwhile, the Stamford branch has its own distraction, the computer war game Call of Duty, being played under the guise of a team-building exercise. New to the game, Jim\\xa0plays poorly and he mentions video games weren\\'t played at his former office. He does, however, reveal a prank in which he and Pam hummed the same high note in the hopes of Dwight scheduling an appointment to have his hearing checked, an activity Pam dubbed \"pretendinitis\".\\nBack in Scranton, Pam shops online for new clothes at Kelly\\'s insistence. Upon the clothes\\' arrival, Kelly demands through chanting that Pam performs a lunchtime fashion show.

Kelly asks if that is his third soda of the day, to which he doesn\\'t respond.\\nIn Stamford, Jim manages to kill a player, but the thrill is short-lived as he is told he\\'s killed a teammate on the German side. As another game starts up, Josh calls Jim and Andy for an impromptu huddle about game strategy. Andy blames the defeat on \"the new guy,\" and as Jim reveals his use of a sniper rifle, both co-workers react in disgust, with Josh scolding Jim for using the weapon on an inappropriate map, and Andy claiming he is going to shoot Jim \"for real.\"\\nUpon Dwight\\'s return, a calm but clearly offended Michael initially tries to make him admit he didn\\'t go to the dentist by feeding him M&M\\'s and asking for the dentist\\'s name, to which Dwight replies \"Crentist.\" When Michael notes how the name sounds strangely like \"dentist,\" Dwight reasons it may have been why he chose the profession. Later, Michael tells Dwight that Jan has called to demote him to Dwight\\'s position as Assistant (to the) Regional Manager, and Dwight should be expecting a call from Corporate to take over as acting Regional Manager. Announcing it to the office, multiple people question Dwight\\'s selection, and Kevin even expresses concern about Michael possibly losing his condo. Angela is the only one to congratulate Dwight, though later\\xa0when she says in private that they could make a difference together, he corrects her to\\xa0say as\\xa0he would\\xa0make a difference. Though Angela seems upset at first, she then smirks as Dwight offers her to be in charge of the female staff.\\nMichael eventually reveals the trick when Dwight casually refuses the keys to Michael\\'s Corporate Chrysler Sebring convertible and insults the vehicle due to its poor gas mileage and impracticality in Scranton\\'s climate. Taking the remark personally, Michael blows up at Dwight after he refuses to take back what he said, especially after Dwight previously stated that he loved the car (a lie meant to appease Michael). In turn, Dwight begins to beg for his job and grovels at the floor for Michael\\'s forgiveness, offering to do his laundry for a month, then a year, to which Michael responds he has a laundry machine. Michael then forgives him and tells\\xa0him to \"Hug it out, bitch,\" which, Michael tells the camera, is what men say and do to each other after a fight (a reference to Michael\\'s obsession with Entourage). Dwight returns quickly to being Michael\\'s loyal right-hand man at the next Movie Monday, as Angela looks on in disappointment.\\nPam decides to return to dressing her usual way at work when Creed walks over to her desk, blatantly looks down her shirt and refuses to leave the area.

Karen tells the camera to \"look at how cute he is,\" before telling Jim to turn his character around. Requesting any last words, she shoots his character point blank. Jim then turns to the camera and whispers \"psychopath.\" At the end of the day, Jim pretends to throw a grenade towards her desk when leaving, to which she tosses a few paper clips in the resulting explosion. They laugh, and after he leaves, she still gives a slight wave and continues to stare at the exit.\\nDeciding he still harbored resentment towards Dwight, Michael forces him to solemnly stand atop a box with a \"LIAR\" sign dangling from his neck, in addition to one year of indentured servitude as a launderer.\\nThe Season Three DVD contains a number of deleted scenes.\\nDeleted scenes not on the DVD:\\nCall of DutyCall of Duty!\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/3_3_The_Coup.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/9_24_and_25_Finale.md'}\ndoc: page_content='The premise of the episode is that the documentary crew has returned to film bonus footage for the DVD release of the documentary. As the office prepares for Dwight and Angela\\'s wedding, they also prepare for a panel regarding the documentary at a local theater. Underwhelming attendance to the event leads to disappointment until they realize the people haven\\'t all been let in yet and are waiting outside. The panel reveals the identity of Erin\\'s birth parents, and Pam reveals she is working on something big to pay Jim back for his DVD shown in A.A.R.M.. That night, Jim and Pam throw bachelor and bachelorette parties for Dwight and Angela, respectively. Jim takes Dwight and the guys to a pub where Dwight is oblivious to the waitress being a stripper, even though Elizabeth is the exotic dancer that Dwight has hired before. Pam and the girls are at a small house, where Jake Palmer returns as the stripper the girls hired for Angela. Everyone except Meredith thinks this is inappropriate considering Jake\\'s mother is present, and Angela does not want a stripper anyway. Phyllis (clearly stooging for the bachelor party) claims to hear a noise and opens the door, causing Angela to be kidnapped by Mose Schrute. Dwight then must search for Angela, as it is revealed this is another absurd Schrute tradition. The search ends at Kevin\\'s bar, where Dwight and Kevin make amends.\\nThe following day is the wedding. Jim pulls one final prank on Dwight: he insists that he cannot be his best man, as Dwight is older than Jim. When Dwight tries to change his mind, Jim directs his attention to Michael Scott, standing in the doorway. An excited Dwight exclaims, \"Michael! I can\\'t believe you came!\" to which Michael replies, \"That\\'s what she said\". In the bridal chamber, it is decided Phyllis will carry Angela down the aisle due to Angela\\'s leg pain from having been in a car trunk for several hours. The two are married (standing in their own graves, as is Schrute tradition \"as a reminder that this is the only escape from what they are about to do\"), and everyone heads to the reception. At the reception, Jim and Pam dance and kiss, and Jim states that Pam no longer owes him anything. Michael and Pam talk, and she reveals he has kids (and takes so many pictures of them he needs two phones). Michael does one final talking head from his table, saying that he feels like all his kids grew up and married each other, which is \"every parent\\'s dream\". Ryan and Kelly run away together, passing Ryan\\'s son to Ravi who then gives the baby to Kevin. Ravi tells him to report an abandoned baby to child services, but Nellie instead takes the child as her own and tells the camera that if Ryan wants his baby back, he can find them \"somewhere in Europe.\"\\nJim and Pam head home and are surprised to find Carol, Michael\\'s former Realtor/ex-girlfriend, showing their house. Pam reveals she has been showing the house for two months, so that if they got an offer, Jim would have no reason not to rejoin Athlead. The couple being shown the house decide they want to buy it, and Jim and Pam agree to sell.\\nThat night there is a DVD release party at the warehouse. Pam reveals her mural, a painting of the office and everyone who works in it. After a group picture, everyone heads up to the office to hang out. Creed is revealed to be living in one of the office\\'s supply closets. Seeing that Erin is busy, Pam takes one final call as the receptionist, which coincidentally is for Jim Halpert. She replies, \"I\\'m sorry, Jim Halpert doesn\\'t work here anymore.\" Soon after they announce their plans to leave to Dwight, who fires them so that they can both receive large severance packages. Creed sings a song while they tell the cameras about how the documentary has affected them. Creed is then arrested and led away by police.

Rainn Wilson later joked that Daniels was \"the country vet who birthed this puppy\" and had come \"back to put it down\". The episode was directed by Ken Kwapis. Kwapis had originally directed the series\\' pilot episode. His last directorial credit for the series, prior to \"Finale\", however, was the fifth season episode \"Company Picnic\".\\n\"I figured the character would go back and visit everybody, but he wouldn\\'t do it on camera at this point. I think he had grown past the idea of being in the documentary, that was my take on it. That [Michael Scott] had said goodbye to that aspect of his life, that that\\'s not what was important to him. I just thought, yeah he\\'d go back and visit, but he wouldn\\'t want the camera crew to be documenting it.\"\\n—Steve Carell, explaining his hesitation to return to The Office.\\nThe series finale will guest star Rachael Harris, Dakota Johnson, Joan Cusack, Ed Begley Jr. and  Malcolm Barrett. The episode will feature the return of several of the series\\' actors and actresses, including former series writers and stars B. J. Novak and Mindy Kaling, as well as Andy Buckley, Bobby Rae Shafer, Michael Schur, and Matt Jones. Early during production for the season, Kinsey and Wilson also noted that the cast and crew were hoping for a return of former lead actor Steve Carell as Michael Scott. In mid-December, Krasinski later revealed that he was optimistic about a return; in an interview with E! Online Krasinski said that the producers were supposedly \"still trying to figure out [Carell\\'s] schedule\" and that the finale \"just wouldn\\'t be the same without him\". However, NBC chairman Robert Greenblatt later admitted during an interview that while he is \"hopeful\", he does not think Carell will return; he noted that Carell was satisfied with his character\\'s exit and did not want to tarnish it. On January 16, Daniels revealed that Carell would not appear in the finale in any capacity, a decision that Carell later reiterated. Three months later, however, the producers for The Office mounted \"an 11th hour effort last month\" to get Carell to make a cameo in the show\\'s final episode, according to TVLine. According to the article, \"while no one is confirming that the final diplomatic push proved successful, no one is denying it either.\" Carell\\'s personal representative confirmed that Carell was on the set for the final episode, but that he did not film any scenes. However, an anonymous source close to the show cryptically said \"don\\'t rule anything out\". TVLine later reported on May 6, that Carell would appear in a cameo, although NBC declined to comment and Carell\\'s representatives continued to deny the reports.\\nThe initial idea for the finale was thought of by Daniels during production of the third season, described as \"a reunion show, in the fashion of the post-competition cast rehashes familiar from reality shows like Survivor.\" Daniels, at one point, approached Jeff Probst, the host of Survivor, to appear in the finale as a moderator for the fictional reunion, although he declined. The initial table read for the episode took place on March 4, 2013. Filming commenced on March 6. According to Jenna Fischer, the episode took nine days to film, with the cast devoting 12 hours a day to the episode. The finale was described as \"ambitious\", featuring multiple location shoots, including one in an AT&T office building, which stood in for the Scranton Cultural Center. Filming for the episode and series as a whole came to an end on March 16, 2013. Wilson later tweeted a picture of the \"empty\" set after all filming had been finished. Originally, the episode was supposed to be the 23rd and 24th episodes of the season, which would have meant that the series aired exactly 200 episodes. However, the series\\' penultimate episode was elongated into 2 separate episodes, resulting in \"Finale\" being the 24th and 25th episodes of the season. This meant that the last part of \"Finale\" will be the series\\' 201st episode. Once filming finished, Daniels in an interview with TVLine expressed his hope to expand the episode, stating, \"I was very excited with the footage we got [...] It\\'s very big. I’m going to beg NBC to super-size it or extend it.\" Daniels later commented that when the editors cut together the first act, it was 23 minutes long; this is much longer than a normal first act for an hour long episode of television. In response, OfficeTally—the largest fan site for the series—started an online petition to supersize the finale, similar to the petition to expand the second-season finale, \"Casino Night\". By May 2, the petition had received over 20,000 signatures. On May 7, it was announced that NBC had extended the episode by 15 minutes, meaning that the episode would be 55 minutes in total.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/9_24_and_25_Finale.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/3_16_Phyllis%27_Wedding.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Phyllis has asked Michael to push her father\\'s wheelchair down the aisle at her wedding, a role that she gave him to secure six weeks off for her honeymoon.

When Uncle Al is reported missing over the PA, Dwight realizes his mistake.\\nMichael makes several crude attempts to recapture the limelight, culminating with an overlong toast at the wedding banquet in which he impugns Phyllis\\' chastity. Outraged, Phyllis\\' husband Bob Vance throws him out of the reception hall. Dwight does not let him re-enter, taking satisfaction in being able to eject a real wedding crasher. Michael finds company with uncle Al, and eventually confesses that he is sorry for his behavior and worried that it may have sullied Phyllis\\' day, although uncle Al is only able to respond with aloof statements.\\nPam is upset that many details of Phyllis\\' wedding, from the invitations to the wedding gown, were copied from her own canceled wedding, and is further rankled when her ex-fiance Roy fails to recognize any of these details. Roy expresses regret over his lack of involvement in their wedding plans and pays \"Scrantonicity\", the Kevin Malone-led wedding band to play their song, \"You Were Meant for Me\".

In a moment of quick thinking, Michael pulls out a party game, Belles, Bourbon & Bullets, but Jim says that they cannot afford to play around. Michael gets his way, saying Jim owes him \\'one\\' after earlier insisting that Michael abandon his idea to run hamster tubes throughout the office, called \"Tube City\".\\nThe staff slowly warms up to the game, which is a murder mystery. It is set in Savannah, Georgia, and everyone has to adopt a Southern accent (with varying degrees of success). Thanks to Pam, Andy, and Phyllis, the game quickly becomes a hit. Almost everyone present starts to play along, except for Oscar (who tries to get updates on the situation from corporate) and Creed (who shows up late to work and flees after being told he is a suspect in a murder). Jim continues to believe the entire exercise is pointless.\\nThroughout the game, Andy is trying his hardest to make a move on Erin, and with the possible impending closure of Dunder Mifflin, decides he needs to make a move now. While \\'in character,\\' he asks Erin out for a weekend date, but becomes unsure if he really asked her out, or if he just simply asked out her murder mystery character, \"Naughty Nelly.\" He is worried that Erin only said yes because Naughty Nelly, a promiscuous, flirtatious, and scandalous woman, \"says yes to everyone and might be a murderer.\"\\nJust as the game seems to get interesting, Oscar returns and reveals even more bad news from corporate. Accounting has been notified to stop payments to vendors, which is in Oscar\\'s words \"unprecedented and should be a cause for concern.\" This brings the staff out of the game and back to the scary reality of losing their jobs. Michael tries to win them back, but accidentally skips to the game\\'s conclusion, revealing the murderer to be Beatrix Bourbon (Phyllis). Michael refuses to give up and continues playing the game with Dwight.\\nAfter the game, Andy and Erin meet at the receptionist desk, where Erin asks him about their upcoming date. Andy chickens out and indicates that the \"date\" was just part of the game, although that was not his original intention. Silence follows, and Erin leaves Andy at reception in embarrassment. She later reveals to the camera that she thought the date was real and was excited about the idea of dating Andy.\\nIn a vain attempt to salvage the day, Michael tries to introduce another murder and other twists to the story to pull his staff back into the game. This infuriates Jim to his breaking point, and they hold a private talk in Michael\\'s office where he begins to yell at him. Michael interrupts Jim angrily and stands his ground, telling Jim \"they need this game\" or they might cave in under the impending bad news and possible closure of Dunder Mifflin, and Jim nods his head in understanding. CFO David Wallace finally returns the Jim\\'s phone calls, and reveals that while nothing has been officially decided yet, Dunder Mifflin is expected to be insolvent by year-end. Knowing how damaging this could be to his staff, Jim deliberately hides this news from them and nudges them back into the game.

Pam shows Jim a box of items for the closing ceremonies and Angela marks off another tally for \"Pam Pong\", to Pam\\'s annoyance. Toby and Oscar race with full coffee mugs around the office, but the games immediately stop when Michael and Dwight return, much to Jim\\'s disappointment.\\nThings get quiet again. Jim fills out the expense reports, which only take five minutes. Ryan throws away Pam\\'s medals which she sadly notices. Pam has 59 voicemails, but attends to Jim\\'s insistence that the closing ceremonies will occur at 5pm. Jim brings out Michael to join in the ceremonies and gives him the gold medal in front of the entire staff for closing on his condo. Michael is moved to tears. A perplexed Dwight gets the silver medal. Jim gets the bronze. Pam plays the national anthem and releases the origami paper doves she made for the ceremonies. The employees smile and Michael wells up with tears.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/2_3_Office_Olympics.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/9_5_Here_Comes_Treble_(Episode).md'}\ndoc: page_content='In order to play a Halloween prank on his coworkers, Dwight wears a jack-o\\'-lantern on his head and succeeds in scaring Erin.

Dwight spends the rest of the day trapped inside it and mentions how it will probably come off in a few months.\\nAs the characters come in they explain their costumes. Pam explains how she is Cinderella since her daughter likes princesses, but she is also a doctor so as to set a positive example for her. Jim explains he is not in costume since he has an investors meeting today.\\nMeanwhile, Andy is very excited as he has gotten the current members of Here Comes Treble, his former a cappella group at Cornell, to come and perform. Andy tries to act as though he is a hero to them and that he was a singing legend, but much to Andy\\'s annoyance he learns that his old friend Broccoli Rob has claimed credit for Andy\\'s college nickname as well as his signature songs. Erin, while somewhat disgusted at some of Andy\\'s college stories, decides to help him by convincing the a capella members to sing Andy\\'s favorite song in front of the office so Andy can do his signature solo and impress the office staff.\\nAngela brings her husband, The Senator, to the Halloween party and he seems happy to see Oscar. He tries to display affection towards him, but Oscar doesn\\'t seem comfortable doing that in front of Angela.\\nDwight meanwhile discovers a pill on the floor. He looks it up and realizes that the pill is used for treating anxiety disorders and believes that someone in the office is deranged. Nellie tries to convince Dwight it is nothing serious as she later reveals the pill belongs to her and it\\'s for a minor anxiety disorder. To prank him, she plays along with his theory of someone in the office being insane and decides to help him catch the owner.\\nJim goes to lunch with the other investors and feels pressured to invest $10,000, but he appears quite reluctant and worried in doing so despite gaining the approval of his fellow friends. He seems worried what Pam will think.\\nDwight and Nellie leave the pill on a plate in the kitchen and wait with a giant butterfly net to capture anyone who claims it. Dwight notices that Darryl expresses interest in it and pretends to act insane hoping Darryl will follow suit. Darryl decides to prank Dwight and tricks him into smearing peanut butter all over his face before denying he had any logic in making him do so. Meredith enters and immediately recognizes the pill, and Dwight captures her in the net thinking that he\\'s found his psycho junkie. Nellie then admits the pill is hers and Dwight is forced to let Meredith go.\\nAndy gathers the office staff in the conference room and the a cappella group begin their song. Jim and Pam meanwhile discuss Jim\\'s plan to invest and they end up arguing throughout the whole song. The a cappella group then surprises Andy with the song \"Faith\", but just as Andy starts his solo Broccoli Rob appears via webcam and begins singing it, completely upstaging Andy.\\nJim and Pam continue to argue about how much Jim invested. When Jim tries to change the subject to the song \"Monster Mash\" Pam uses it as a metaphor for Jim\\'s decision. Kevin believes they are actually arguing over the song however.\\nAndy and Broccoli Rob continue to argue over the true history of their college days before Erin has heard enough and pulls the plug on the monitor Broccoli Rob was talking through. She convinces Andy that his college days are over and while he probably can\\'t relate to the new members he could be sort of a mentor to them. She proposes that Andy have his parents donate money to the group rather than just exist in stories to them. Andy calls his mother and disturbingly learns that his parents are in fact broke.\\nDwight, feeling a lot of stress lately and still bothered by the fact that Philip was not his baby, asks Nellie if he could get a prescription for \"Mose\".

The word \"ship\" is hidden inside the word \"leadership,\" as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain!\" When they arrive on the boat, however, Michael immediately feels threatened by the ship\\'s captain, Captain Jack, who declares that he will be the ship\\'s \"party captain\" for the evening. A hilarious battle for top authority on the ship ensues, with Michael echoing everything Captain Jack says.\\nJim brings Katy, his new girlfriend, (played by Amy Adams) as his date, and Pam brings Roy along. The four soon start talking, and it becomes clear that Katy and Roy enjoy each other more than they do their respective partners. Pam and Jim are left alone together, and the romantic tension is palpable. As the party inside begins, Michael tries unsuccessfully to motivate his staff and is disappointed when Captain Jack does a better job. \\xa0The awkwardness Michael creates is magnified by the fact Dunder Mifflin\\'s group is not the only group on the boat. When Dwight volunteers to hold the limbo stick, Captain Jack sends him outside to \"steer the ship.\" Angela asks Dwight to come inside and talk to her, but he refuses, saying \"I can\\'t. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!\" (The wheel Dwight is so seriously manning turns out to be fake). When Captain Jack leaves the festivities with Meredith, Michael claims wildly that the ship is sinking and will be at the bottom of the lake in mere minutes. At first no one believes him, but soon people start to panic and one passenger jumps overboard. Captain Jack returns and, after discovering what Michael has done, handcuffs him to the railing outside to prevent him from causing any more trouble. Roy, motivated by Captain Jack\\'s stories about commitment (and slightly drunk), announces to Pam that it\\'s time to set a date for their wedding. He suggests June 10th, and Pam happily accepts. After seeing this, Jim becomes depressed and soon breaks up with Katy, who is shocked and upset. Jim then admits to Michael that he has strong feelings for Pam. Michael more surprised than anything tells him he usually has a radar that kind of thing. Jim looks down and seems ready to let Pam go, Michael tells him that if he really likes her then he shouldn\\'t give up.

As the new office administrator and an investor in WUPHF.com, Pam ignores it. Michael\\xa0and Ryan talk about WUPHF.com and how it has an offer to be purchased, but Ryan insists the company can be worth a lot more money if they had more investors to fine-tune it before they sell. The two make an announcement that they are inviting more people in as investors. No one bites, so the current investors remain\\xa0Darryl, Andy, Pam, and Stanley. They meet with Ryan and Michael in the conference room. Everybody wants to sell the company that only has 9 days before bankruptcy, except Ryan, who uses Michael\\'s friendship against him to keep the majority vote. Kelly enters the room, claiming she came up with the idea and that she wants to sue. Ryan coddles her and tells the investors that he\\'ll take care of everything. In the break room, Pam tries to convince Michael that Ryan is using him and that other people could be hurt financially if Ryan doesn\\'t sell WUPHF.com, which is only valuable because of its domain name that will be bought by the Washington University Public Health Fund. Michael claims he has faith in Ryan. Michael tests Pam\\'s theory and when Ryan dodges attempts to hang out and encourages Michael to take out a second mortgage on his condo, Michael sees some truth. Later, Darryl pulls Ryan out of his closet and the four investors try to bully Ryan into selling, but Michael comes in. He eventually gives Ryan an ultimatum to make WUPHF.com profitable in 9 days. After pondering, Ryan decides to sell the domain name.\\nMeanwhile, Jim is on a hot sales streak. After talking with Kevin and learning he isn\\'t getting any commission from his latest sales, he approaches Gabe. Gabe informs him of Sabre\\'s new commission cap but insists Jim still keep busy. With no motivation, Jim grows extremely bored. After attempting to goof off with Creed, he decides to focus his efforts on pranking Gabe by editing Jo Bennett\\'s\\xa0audiobook to insult Gabe and trick him into sitting through the entire thing, using manipulated audio of Jo\\'s voice to order him to note any changes in the book.\\nAs the owner of the business park, Dwight hosts a Hay Festival\\xa0in the parking lot. He gets so carried away that he misses his scheduled rendezvous with Angela, who meets Robert Lipton, a widower taking his son to the Hay Festival. The two begin to flirt, and Robert asks Angela if it\\'s alright for him to call her. Angela voids Dwight\\'s contract and tapes it to the door of their meeting place.

Andy, having been cheated on himself, steps up and makes Michael confront his girlfriend\\'s husband. They both go to visit him while he\\'s coaching a high school baseball team, and Andy manages to get the two of them to talk. However, this does little to sway Michael toward ending the affair, instead Michael is emboldened by the encounter.\\nMeanwhile, Dwight and Angela are dealing with fallout from the baby contract they signed a few months earlier. Instead of going to court, they have asked a mediator to sort out their issues. After studying the contract line by line, the mediator concludes that the contract is basically a valid surrogate parent contract. However, one cannot force two people to have sexual relations and produce a baby. Instead, Angela could sue Dwight for damages up to thirty thousand dollars for breach of contract. Knowing that Dwight would never want to pay her damages, she offers him a \"settlement\" that consists of five separate sessions of intercourse. He accepts, gloating that \"thirty thousand for sex isn\\'t bad at all.\" Before the first \"session\", Dwight subjects himself to various ordeals in order to sterilize himself.\\nJim and Pam are both exhausted from the long nights with their new baby, and it\\'s adversely affecting their work. Gabe catches them both sleeping at their desks and reprimands them privately.

Darryl catches the couple discussing how to get enough energy to make it through the day and informs them of a secret sleeping place in the warehouse. From this location, Jim and Pam inadvertently overhear Dwight and Angela\\'s first \"session.\"\\nAfter returning from the baseball game, Michael shows no sincere change in attitude towards cheating with Donna, despite having talked with her husband. The rest of the office turns cold towards him. No one, not even Meredith or Creed, agrees with what Michael is doing. When he tries to defend his position in front of everyone, they snap back. Out of spite, he announces that he will now leave to secretly meet Donna at a motel for sex, but on the way there he has a change of heart and breaks up with her via text message instead. He consoles himself, alone, with his favorite ice cream after returning heartbroken.\\nAt the end of the episode, Michael is ambushed by the media.

Jim, who had turned down the temporary manager position believing that they should not be assigned one at all, is especially unhappy with the changes, and begins pranking Dwight by suggesting that he is leading an uprising called \"The Fist\". In order to impress Jo, Dwight buys a gun, though he is more excited when he receives a holster as a gift from a relative, and uses the gun to accessorize. Pam insists that he put it away, but Dwight accidentally fires the gun right by Andy, causing him temporary hearing loss. He attempts to bribe the office workers into silence with various favors, and Jim insists that Dwight do outlandish things (such as saying, \"Shagedelic, baby!\") at certain promptings.\\nMeanwhile, Gabe continues with his attempts to win back Erin. He invites Andy to go to the conference room to speak in private. He breaks down, and Andy promises he won\\'t date Erin again.

He attempts to divert the blame to his employees, saying that blackmail is a bigger crime than firing a gun accidentally, but Jo takes the position away from him. Jo later puts Creed, who has the most experience and seniority in the office, in charge until a committee composed of Jim, Toby, and Gabe, find a replacement.

Pam coaches Erin, saying if she doesn\\'t love Gabe she should break things off with him, as to not lead him on any further.

Jim reveals to Roy that he is engaged to Pam, which Roy congratulates him on, and also mentions that Pam is at art school in New York. He tells Roy about the night before which she spent with friends, to which he responds that Jim was also once her friend, suggesting that Pam may do to Jim what she did to Roy. Jim then decides to drive to New York to visit Pam, but just before getting onto I-80 towards New York turns around because he is not \"that guy\" and he and Pam are not \"that couple\".\\nWhen the time comes to open bidding for the Springsteen tickets, Michael claims he can\\'t find them and tells everyone that they were stolen in the robbery. At the end of the episode, Michael tells Holly that he lied about the tickets being stolen and about the tickets in general. They kiss, catching the eye of a visibly displeased David Wallace.\\nDeleted scenes not on the DVD\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/5_5_Crime_Aid.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/5_14_and_15_Stress_Relief.md'}\ndoc: page_content='As Dwight\\'s actions could have burned down the building or killed Stanley, Corporate is not amused. Michael and Dwight are called on the carpet in New York, Michael to be reminded of his responsibilities to his subordinates and Dwight to be warned that he is subject to being fired. On the drive back home, Michael revokes Dwight\\'s status as safety advisor. Back in Scranton, because he hadn\\'t had any idea how to give first aid to Stanley, Michael has the American Red Cross send over an instructor (and most importantly a dummy) to teach CPR. Dwight pouts, Andy sings, and naturally no one learns anything except the lyrics to The Bee Gee\\'s song \"Stayin\\' Alive\" - and that Dwight looked very realistic wearing the face of the dummy a la “Silence of the Lambs”. Most importantly, Dwight takes the scenario far too seriously and mutilates the dummy to “harvest the organs.” CFO David Wallace and Corporate HR Kendall, upset that Dwight\\'s mutilating the dummy cost the company $3500, requires Dwight to apologize to his co-workers and get their acknowledgement of his apology in writing. Michael signs the apology without much thought, but the rest of Dwight\\'s coworkers refuse. Dwight tricks everyone except Phyllis into signing the sheet by pretending that it is an an attendance sheet. Dwight finally gets Phyllis\\'s signature by having a fake delivery sent to her.\\nMichael tries a number of ways to get his employees to unwind, like soft music and meditation, before discovering that he is the number one cause of stress at work. So that people won\\'t feel afraid of him, he insists on a no-holds-barred roast of himself. He actually thought that each speaker would also express love for him, so while the employees had a great time, Michael ends up with his feelings hurt. Later, after taking a \"Personnel Day,\" he recovers and conducts a mini-roast of his employees - initially making them somewhat uncomfortable, before Stanley bursts into laughter about his joke and the rest of the office jumps in.\\nWhile all of this has been going on, Andy is convinced that Jim and Pam are film gurus because they are talking about Pam\\'s parents as the three watch a pirated movie, but Andy thinks they\\'re talking about the movie—and by chance, it sounds like it. The episode features movie stars Jack Black, Cloris Leachman, and Jessica Alba in the film, Mrs. Albert Hannaday, which features what some would consider a taboo subject, a love triangle with a \"May - late-December\" relationship. Andy does not know that Jim and Pam were actually discussing Pam\\'s mother and father\\'s deteriorating relationship. Pam\\'s father stays with Pam and Jim for several days. Pam asks Jim to talk to her father and see if her dad will tell Jim what is wrong with his relationship with Pam\\'s mother. After the two men talk her father says he is going to get his own apartment. Jim has no idea what he could have said to make Pam\\'s father leave her mother for good. Later Pam is stunned by revelations on two fronts: 1) that Jim has been deeply in love with her since the beginning and 2) that her father never felt a deep emotion for her mother - Mr. Beesly realized the latter after hearing the former from the heart, and that was what Jim had said. In a talking heads interview, Pam says that although most children expect their parents to be soulmates, Pam and Jim\\'s children “will be right about that.” She also says that love affairs and relationships look different from the outside, which is overhead by a frustrated Andy, who (once again) believes she is talking about the film they watched and decides he is not fit to be a movie critic.\\nThese were notable cuts from this episode as seen on the Season 5 DVD:\\nDwight: (clears throat)\\nPam: oh my god uh oh my god.\\nStanley: fire.\\nDwight: oh fire oh my goodness what’s the procedure?

Michael will still not accept that there will be any staff cuts. Dwight feels particularly threatened by the impending crisis, and, in an act of desperation, forms an alliance with his office nemesis Jim. Jim sees the alliance as an opportunity with great potential and agrees as a lark. He immediately enlists Pam's help in the situation.\\nMeanwhile, Michael tries to boost morale in the office by having an office birthday party for Meredith, even though her birthday is a month away. Since this isn't really about Meredith, Michael has no problem despite ordering an ice cream cake even though she's lactose intolerant. He also agonizes over writing an insulting joke in her birthday card that he thinks will be hilarious. In the meantime, Oscar asks Michael for a donation for his nephew's cerebral palsy walk-a-thon. Michael looks over the $2 and $3 contributions and, feeling generous, signs up for $25. When Jim points out that the dollar amounts are per mile which adds up, Michael goes to Oscar to explain his misunderstanding. Oscar reminds him what a walk-a-thon is and thinks Michael is being cheap for retracting a charitable donation.\\nMeredith getting surprised by the office-workers.Meredith would eventually walk into the office with Angela, with the rest saying happy birthday to her. Meredith first responds assuming that it is for somebody else, but when corrected, she is put into a visible state of confusion. \\nMeanwhile, Dwight, following Jim and Pam's efforts, ends up in a box in the warehouse to overhear information. Back in the office, the party falls flat when Michael's insulting jokes fail to amuse Meredith or anyone else.\\nAt the end of the day, after a breakthrough in his pranks on Dwight, Jim giddily grabs Pam's hand in an attempt to explain what has just happened. However, Pam's fiancé Roy walks in and immediately assumes Jim is hitting on her. Jim tries to explain that they were just playing a joke on Dwight by pretending to be in an alliance with him. Dwight, not finding it funny, denies any knowledge.\\nThe Season One DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode.

Michael is determined to make the party match the joy in his heart at Toby leaving, but when Angela balks at his unreasonable demands, such as an anti-gravity machine, Phyllis accepts the duty of planning the party. She does fantastically, ordering carnival rides to the parking lot and hiring Darryl\\'s band, much to Angela\\'s chagrin.\\nMichael\\'s hatred of Toby seems to have been transferred to the new HR representative, Holly, and he and Dwight plan to haze her. When she shows disdain for Toby, though, Michael suddenly thinks he is falling in love with her. Jim advises him to fight his over-aggressive instincts and play it slow, recounting his story on how he fell in love with Pam. Michael succeeds in warming up to Holly with less-obnoxious small talk and jokes. Michael even tempers Toby\\'s exit interview, which he originally planned to be brutal and insulting, when Holly attends. When Michael\\'s cruel going-away present (a rock with the words \"Suck On This\") is revealed, Pam cons Michael into giving Toby his sports watch. Dwight continues the hazing, telling Holly that Kevin is mentally challenged and putting a raccoon in her car. When Michael chastises him in front of everyone, Holly is even more receptive. Meanwhile, Kevin misinterprets Holly\\'s praise of his ability to perform mundane tasks that would be difficult for a mentally challenged individual as romantic interest.\\nPam is accepted to study graphic design at Pratt Institute, for which she will have to go to New York City for three months. A supportive Jim assures her that, while the separation will not be fun, it is still a great opportunity. Meanwhile, when Jim calls Ryan about his huge sale in Job Fair, Ryan instructs him to enter the sale on the company\\'s website before abruptly hanging up. Jim leaves Ryan a voicemail proclaiming that he will fight for his position at Dunder Mifflin, despite Ryan\\'s attempts to push him out. Shortly afterwards, the staff finds a video on YouTube of Ryan being arrested for fraud (though while describing what he\\'d done in a talking head, Oscar jokes that Ryan\\'s attempt at a beard was his \"real\" crime). Michael is greatly concerned for his \"friend\" Ryan, but Jim takes pleasure in the video and leaves Ryan a second voicemail telling him to disregard the last message \"since [his] hands are tied.\"\\nJim also contributes to the party-planning fund in order to buy fireworks. He claims it is to give Toby a proper send-off, but later reveals that he has decided to propose to Pam after recounting his story to Michael. Pam notices the purchase and guesses his intentions in an interview; however, at the party, just before Jim can pop the question, Andy ruins the moment by proposing to Angela (who responds with a halfhearted \"Okay\"). Dwight is crushed but says, \"It\\'s my own fault.\" Jim puts the ring back in his pocket. In a later interview, Pam is visibly disappointed, thinking she had guessed wrong. Toby gets the pictures he wanted of him and Pam together and leaves the office forever, but Michael gets in a final shot when he has Hank, the security guard escort Toby from the building.\\nKevin runs into Jan at the grocery store and calls Michael to come talk to her. Michael discovers that Jan has artificially inseminated herself from a sperm bank and wants him to be involved in the pregnancy. He initially is indecisive, but eventually calls and agrees to attend lamaze class with her in Allentown.\\nRight at the end of the episode, Phyllis returns to the dark office to stow away party supplies\\xa0with the camera crew and compares party planning to a runner\\'s high, evidently pleased at the success of her party, but on her way in, she hears moaning and walks in on Angela and Dwight having sex at Angela\\'s desk, which is also recorded by the camera crew accompanying Phyllis.

After playing, Robert tells Jim that he dislikes the business plan for the Sabre store; he only approved it because Jo Bennett wanted it, but he plans to sandbag it at a high-level meeting, and Jim is stunned when Robert strongly hints he's going to fire Dwight over it. Jim makes several attempts to stop Dwight from attending the meeting with Robert, but Dwight is heedless and continually insults Jim, who finally decides to leave Dwight to his fate. However, a guilt-inducing phone call to Pam makes Jim decide he has to keep parsing Dwight's insults until he directly tells him that he's going to lose his job. Dwight ignores the news, thinking Jim is jealous of him, so Jim resorts to wrestling with Dwight outside the conference room. In the meantime, Nellie has Todd Packer stand in as VP in Dwight's absence. When Dwight makes it into the conference room, he hears Robert planning to fire the VP, so he sneaks out of the conference room and lets Packer take the fall in front of those present. Dwight then silently extends a hand to Jim, and they head back to Scranton with Stanley, who has reverted to his old grumpy self over the thought of leaving Florida.\\nBack in Scranton, Darryl and Toby are both trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's requests clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell to in order to not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who will sell Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can't make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point they continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they'd do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he'll do any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith to prove it, but they still refuse.\\nMeanwhile, Andy learns that Erin isn't coming back to Scranton after she takes a job helping an elderly lady she met at the Sabre store opening, leaving Andy very distraught.

He informs the documentary crew that he received a Christmas bonus of \"3,000 g\\'s\" ($3,000) for coming under budget due to firing Devon. He wants to serve liquor at the party, but Pam reminds him that Corporate does not allow alcohol at company parties.\\nDwight informs the employees to put their Secret Santa presents under the tree. Toby got a poster of babies dressed as jazz musicians paying instruments for Angela, Oscar knows nothing about Creed but thinks he\\'s Irish so got him a shamrock keychain, and Kevin, who drew his own name for Secret Santa and didn\\'t tell anybody, reveals he got something for himself. Jim has gotten Pam for the first time, bought her a teapot and filled it with little mementos as inside jokes. He also has a card for her, since Christmas is the time to tell people how you really feel.\\nMichael tries to get people to tell him who they got. Jim reminds him it\\'s supposed to be secret. Michael ignores him and reveals that he got Ryan.\\nThe gift exchange starts off reasonably well. Oscar gets a shower radio from Kelly. Jim gets an old shirt from Creed (Creed forgot about the exchange and pulled the shirt out of his closet at the last minute). When Ryan opens his gift from Michael, he finds a $400 video iPod. He knows how much it cost because Michael left the tag on it. Michael brushes it off as just being a generous giver, but the other employees are concerned at the huge disparity between the iPod and the other gifts. Pam opens Jim\\'s gift. He starts to open the lid to show her the contents and explain them when Michael demands his own gift.\\nMichael\\'s magnanimity only lasts as long as it takes for him to open Phyllis\\' gift to him: a home-made oven mitt. He storms out of the party circle, visibly upset. For the cameras, he expresses his belief that the cost of the gift reflects the level of one\\'s affection for the person receiving the gift. This oven mitt isn\\'t worth anything. And, after all, he got Ryan an iPod.\\nWhen he returns, he decides the exchange is going to turn into a Yankee Swap where people can steal other gifts. This doesn\\'t work well at all. The gifts were bought for specific people based on the tastes of those people. For example, a pretty decorated name plate that says Kelly on it. (Stanley: \"It\\'s for Kelly\")\\nAngela frets to the camera how much work goes into planning a party like this and how unfair it is for Michael to come in and make sudden changes. She bursts into tears.\\nKelly gets Angela\\'s baby poster and hates it. Angela steals it back. Kevin makes sure he gets his foot bath. The iPod\\'s expense makes it the most popular of the gifts which starts to cause resentment among the employees. Jim is a little hurt when Pam takes the iPod over stealing back the teapot, making her feel guilty. Worse, Michael is obnoxious when it comes to the oven mitt, loudly hoping no one steals it from him. Seeing how distressed Phyllis is, Meredith steals it from Michael out of pity. Michael nearly jumps for joy and brags about how effective reverse psychology is. However, his smugness is short-lived when he receives what turns out to be Dwight\\'s gift; a packet of paintball pellets and a gift-voucher for paintball lessons with Dwight. Infuriated, Michael removes the elf ears Dwight is wearing and throws them in his face. \\nPhyllis abruptly leaves. Michael cluelessly asks what she\\'s so upset about. Pam points out that it was pretty obvious he didn\\'t like the present she gave him. When Michael defensively tries to claim that the Yankee Swap was a success, the employees -- all visibly unhappy -- disagree; Jim complains that the gifts were not chosen with a Yankee Swap in mind, and that Michael has ruined things by trying to force the situation. Furthermore, for all his protestations even Michael is still unhappy with the gift he\\'s ended up with. Stanley grouses about how Michael should have just bought a $20 gift like everybody else.\\nUpset, Michael blurts out that he was just trying to spread some Christmas joy since he got a big bonus for Christmas, accidentally revealing that the bonus was for firing Devon. Stunned, the employees ask him how much it was. He tries to be cagey, but isn\\'t smart enough to pull it off. In disgust, the employees break off into their own small groups and the exchange is over.\\nIn a talking head Michael, lacking self-awareness of how his greed, petulance and pettiness has ruined things, complains about how no one appreciates the \"nicest thing anyone\\'s ever done\" for them. Michael says \"Happy Birthday, Jesus.

He mumbles, \"I don\\'t know, like a sweater or something.\"\\nMichael returns with the vodka and says, \"Uh oh, looks like Santa\\'s been a little naughty\". Todd Packer shows up already drunk and eventually passes out in a chair. Phyllis introduces everyone to her new beau, Bob Vance, who greets everyone with \"Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration\". Ryan mirthfully asks him what line of work he\\'s in.\\nJim approaches Pam\\'s desk to find out that she traded the iPod for the teapot. He tells her that the gift has \"bonus gifts\" and she pulls the little items out, such as his yearbook photo, a condiment packet, a mini-golf pencil she\\'d used once. While Pam\\'s distracted, Jim secretly pulls out the card and slides it into his back pocket.\\nKevin puts photo copies of his own butt around the office.\\nA drunk Kelly kisses Dwight, who tells her it was inappropriate and that it\\'s a \"man\\'s job\" to make the first move.

He mistakenly thinks it\\'s from Pam but she explains it\\'s from corporate headquarters.\\nCarol receives her Christmas card from Michael and visits him to voice her disapproval of his Photoshopping himself into a two-year-old ski weekend photo with her children and former husband (Michael replaces her husband\\'s face with his own). This, along with his marriage proposal (in the episode \"Diwali\"), pushes her over the edge, and she breaks off the relationship, leaving Michael (who has already booked a trip for the two of them to Sandals Resorts) heartbroken.\\nPam gives Jim her gift: she has been sending Dwight messages from the CIA for several months (including a request of Dwight to admit all the secrets he\\'s sworn never to tell anyone) and she\\'s going to let Jim decide the top secret mission that Dwight will go on.

After a few tense moments, Stanley stands up and goes to Pam and Karen\\'s party; several other people follow him except for Kevin, Phyllis, and Hannah. Kevin tells the camera that he is mainly convinced to go because he has heard that Angela\\'s party will have double-fudge brownies, and that outweighs the fact that Angela herself will be there. Michael, Andy, Jim, and Dwight arrive at a Benihana restaurant (which Michael refers to as \"Asian Hooters\"). Andy slides into a seat next to Michael and arranges the seating so Dwight is seated on the opposite end of the table and out of earshot of the conversation of the rest of the entourage. Andy convinces Michael to ask out his Japanese waitress after getting him slightly drunk. So drunk, in fact, that he actually steals meat from the plate of Justin Spitzer, which causes a quick chopstick-sword fight between them. Unable to hear these conversations, Dwight asks Jim to fill him in, but instead Jim tricks him into telling the waitress how to properly butcher a goose, which disgusts both the waitress and the others at the table - while initially attempting to explain himself, Jim finally smiles and admits that it was just the same as all the other pranks he\\'d pulled on Dwight.

Angela is comforted by Dwight\\'s attendance at her party (even though he went to the other party first) until Karen and Pam come in and inform Dwight that he\\'s won the raffle from their party.

Angela agrees and reveals that she stole the power cord for the karaoke machine. As everyone has fun singing, Michael—who is very drunk—confuses his date with Andy\\'s since, as he states, \"all waitresses look alike.\" He goes into the kitchen where both the waitresses are and he discreetly tries to ask aloud where his one was and finally she acknowledges herself and he discreetly marks her arm with a marker.\\nThe two waitresses leave because they say the party \"blows\", and Michael offers his girl a trip to Sandals Jamaica, where he was going to take Carol. She says no since she has classes, although she does take a bike that Michael had intended to give to the charity toy drive.\\nA depressed Michael sulks on the couch and Jim comes up and joins him. Jim gets Michael to laugh at the whole situation and lets him realize that what he had with the waitress was nothing more than a rebound. Jim then tells Michael that a rebound is a fun distraction, but when it is over, \"you\\'re still thinking about the girl you\\'re really after—the one who broke your heart\" (echoing Jim\\'s relationship with Karen after his being rejected by Pam). The two sit in silence as they think.\\nAs the Christmas party ends, Angela sings karaoke, Pam gives Toby her robe from corporate that Dwight had taken, and Jim and Karen give each other the same Christmas gift (a DVD copy of Bridget Jones\\'s: Edge of Reason), seeing which makes Pam sad. Later Pam receives a gift from Roy, which Jim sees. Michael makes a phone call to an unknown person (Who is later revealed to be Jan) to ask her to accompany him to Sandals; to Michael\\'s surprise, the person says yes. Oscar and Gil return from their three-month vacation in Europe. Looking around, Oscar says \"Too soon\" and leaves.\\nWhile Jim is leaving, he decides to go ahead and take Pam up on her \"gift\" offer from earlier. He tells Pam that Dwight will be summoned by the CIA to meet with them. Pam quickly looks up how much a bus ticket will cost, and when she mentions it will cost $75, Jim tells her that the CIA will be sending a helicopter instead. The next scene shows Dwight on the roof waiting for a helicopter. He then receives a text message reading, \"You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone.\" Dwight throws his phone off the roof and walks away.\\n\\n\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/3_10_and_11_A_Benihana_Christmas.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/5_9_Frame_Toby.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Michael tries to get CFO David Wallace to get rid of Toby, but David Wallace is annoyed with Michael for misusing the term \"911\" instead and wonders why the regional manager didn\\'t notice Toby\\'s return for an entire week. Michael says he has been unaware of Toby\\'s return as he hasn\\'t gone back to the annex since Holly was transferred. David says that he will just have to accept the fact that Toby is back and that he can only be fired for cause. (Michael\\'s explanation of \"it\\'s be-cause I hate him\" does not qualify.)\\nMichael tries to pretend to be friends with Toby, but he finds himself unable to do so. He then schemes with Dwight to frame Toby with a fireable offense. First, he tries to set up Toby up for sexual harassment via Pam, but Pam foils Michael\\'s scheme. He then knocks some pictures out of Toby\\'s hand and tries to goad Toby into hitting him, but Toby says he won\\'t do it. Michael decides that \"the ends justify the mean\" and buys \"two pounds of marijuana\" for $500 from Leo and Gino from Vance Refrigeration and hides it in Toby\\'s desk. Dwight then tips the police about possible narcotics in the office. Two policemen arrive and Dwight takes them to Toby\\'s desk. Toby panics and Michael seems to regret his actions as he tries to call them off. The police search Toby\\'s desk and find a bag of Caprese salad in one of the drawers, which the Vance Refrigeration guys had clearly sold to Michael on purpose, knowing he would not know the difference. The policemen leave and Toby berates Michael for calling the cops on him, specifically wasting their time when they could be out catching real criminals. Michael is disgusted that Toby is more worried about the cops\\' time than about possibly being framed, and begrudgingly accepts that Toby is again a member of the office. Creed clearly shows concern when the cops arrive, stepping forward with hands upraised when they head towards Toby\\'s desk, and then telling the camera crew to pretend they are talking until the cops leave.\\nPam gets frustrated when she finds a big mess in the microwave. She writes an anonymous memo on the microwave telling everyone to keep it clean, which nobody seems to care about, save for Angela, who agrees with the message, and Ryan, who tries to manipulate Pam into cleaning the microwave before being reminded that doing so is a temp\\'s job, which he still refuses to do. Meredith all but admits to leaving the mess when she starts talking about how she doesn\\'t have time to clean up after herself because she doesn\\'t get paid to be a maid between her job at the office, tending to her children and being a part-time maid. Ryan tells Kelly that they have to break up again because he is allegedly going on a trip to Thailand with friends from high school (or, more accurately, friends from a high school). He asks her to have sex with him one last time and for any extra cash she may have, to which she hesitantly agrees.\\nIt is revealed to the entire office that Jim bought his parents\\' house without asking Pam, mentioning to the camera crew that he is helping out his mother and getting a good deal. Jim begins to think keeping it a secret from Pam might have been a bad idea. Nevertheless, he takes her after work to show her. He gives her a tour of the imperfect house before showing her the garage, which he turned into an art studio for her. After noticing a seemingly disappointed look on Pam\\'s face, Jim tells her he acknowledges that the house is not perfect and that he took a big risk buying it without telling her. He lets her know that it is okay if she does not like it, but Pam excitedly tells him that she loves the house.\\nThe episode ends with Dwight narrating his perfect crime.\\nIn a deleted scene, Pam holds up a memo.\\nScenes from the producer\\'s cut:\\nThese scenes from the script did not make the aired episode.

Jan walks out of the office as Pam begins to protest.\\nDwight pesters Ryan about his excitement level for his first-ever sales call and informs the camera why he is so excited: Ryan has yet to make an ally within the office, and Dwight hopes to steer him clear of being a \"slacker-loser-wiseass like Jim\" and draft him in the \"Dwight army of champions.\" That afternoon, Dwight drives Ryan to a beet field, smirks to the cameraman in the backseat and tells Ryan \"Your journey begins now.\"\\nAt Dunder Mifflin Stamford, Karen is disturbed to find her chair squeaks and accuses Jim of a chair swap. He protests that he simply switched them back after she made the original switch. Karen promises to switch chairs while he\\'s away from his desk, so he vows not to stand and proves such by rolling to the copy machine.\\nOn a phone call, Michael imitates Bill Cosby: \"I love Jell-O puddin\\' pops. My son Theo loves puddin\\' pops, too.\" Pam shows the camera \"Cosby Impression\" for the 10:00 hour in the log.\\nDwight asks Ryan to take the beet seed from his palm. Ryan misses and Dwight asks him to try again. However, Ryan is faster and takes the seed leaving Dwight in an awkward position. After that, The Assistant Regional Manager asks Ryan to plant the beet seed. Dwight says to the young salesman \"just as you planted that seed, I shall plant my seed in you\" to which the young salesman says \"I don\\'t think you know what you\\'re saying.\" Dwight says the bad odor in the area is \"called bull crap\" and states that \"clients can smell it from a mile away\". Dwight suddenly announces he forgot something in his car and runs toward the vehicle, gets in and speeds away.\\nA loudspeaker announces free soft pretzels being given away in the lobby. Stanley and Michael immediately head for the door. In interviews, Stanley proclaims that pretzel day is his favorite day of the year, Pam admits it is a big deal for some people and Michael says he cannot be productive when there is one thing in his brain which he just can\\'t get out, especially when that one thing is soft pretzels.\\nA long pretzel line peeves Michael and he and Stanley rebuff Phyllis\\' attempt to jump the line with Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration; Stanley sees past his disdain for Michael and high-fives him. Pam asks Michael to use his time in line to authorize some checks, but he instead has her hold his place in line while he uses the restroom. She offers to brings him a pretzel if Michael returns to the office, but he explains that if she ordered his pretzel incorrectly \"then ... this whole thing\\'s blown.\" Shown to the camera, the productivity log now reads \"Stood in Pretzel line\" for the noon hour.\\nAngry Ryan walks alone up a dirt road, muttering to himself. He knocks on a barn door, and Dwight jumps out: \"Congratulations, resourceful salesman! Welcome to Schrute Farm!\" Dwight then gives him his signature salute. Having passed Dwight\\'s second challenge, Ryan sits in a Victorian-era wheelchair and Dwight assures him to \"Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground!\"\\nDwight quizzes Ryan about Dunder Mifflin, the death of company co-founder Robert Mifflin, the purpose of the DHARMA Initiative, and Michael\\'s greatest fear, to which Ryan answers, \"Loneliness. Maybe women.\" Dwight responds, \"Wrong. He\\'s not afraid of anything. Also I would have accepted snakes.\"\\nDwight later states that one cannot sell, if one has fear. Suddenly, Mose appears with the word \"Fear\" on his shirt in tape, and Dwight tells Ryan as his final test he must wrestle Mose to the ground. Ryan calls Dwight a freak and storms out, despite Dwight\\'s protests and instructions to get inside a coffin. Mose remarks \"he seemed nice,\" and Dwight asks \"Where are all the animals?\"\\nAt Stamford, Karen begins to continually squeak her chair. Jim quickly begins to sing the chorus of The Cardigans\\' \"Lovefool\", despite Karen\\'s objections that it is an unfair retaliation and the song will be in her head all day. The camera pans to Andy, who is conducting and lip syncing along with Jim\\'s vocals, out of sight. In an interview, Andy completes the song\\'s chorus — \"I don\\'t care \\'bout anything but you\" — and ponders the whereabouts of the band. Eventually the squeaky chair gets passed to Andy when he isn\\'t in the room.\\nMichael finally arrives at the front of the line and orders \"The Works\" — a sweet pretzel with all 18 sweet toppings. Back upstairs, he plays energetic music, then suddenly emerges from his office and launches into a hyperactive, sugar-fueled speech filled with suggestions on improving office efficiency.\\nInside his Trans Am, Dwight catches up with Ryan as he walks along the road, apologizes and displays gifts Mose sent, including fresh eggs, fatback bacon, and \"something he whittled,\" which appears to be a Venus of Willendorf figurine. After being pleaded with, Ryan gets in the car where Dwight explains that the lack of a friendship with Jim was the main impetus for the initiation ceremony. Dwight then begins to give Ryan sales-call pointers which Ryan tries to memorize. His final advice is for Ryan to \"K.I.S.S. — Keep It Simple Stupid.\"\\nMichael sleeps face-down on his desk. Jan phones for him, but Pam says he\\'s on a sales call.\\nA dejected Ryan walks out of the sales call as Dwight tries to cheer him up. Ryan gripes that the potential client told him to his face that they didn\\'t like him. In retaliation, Ryan begins to throw Mose\\'s eggs at the building and the parking sign. Surprised at Ryan\\'s initiative, Dwight joins him, shouting \"Oh no, no, no,\" until two security guards come out, at which point the pair peel out of the parking lot in Dwight\\'s Firebird. They go to a bar and drink boilermakers, and as a result of the day\\'s events, Dwight no longer calls Ryan \"Temp\" but instead uses his given name.\\nAt the end of the work day, Pam realizes that Michael\\'s antics helped him make a large sale. Having forgotten Kevin\\'s phone extension, Jim calls Dunder Mifflin\\'s main number, hoping to leave him a voicemail regarding a fantasy football issue. Pam answers and says she\\'s staying late because of her new assignment to chronicle Michael\\'s work day, a copy of which she promises to send to Jim. The pair enjoy a long chat about her tiny apartment and her scary solo movie night in which she rented 28 Days Later rather than 28 Days. They start to reconnect, but Ryan and Dwight, both exhausted, return to the office for a few seconds and she loudly says goodbye to the pair as they exit. Jim misconstrues the exclamation, and the pair hang up.\\nA satiated Stanley remarks in an interview that in 364 days, it will once again be Pretzel Day.\\nThe Season Three DVD contains a number of deleted scenes.\\nAdditional deleted scenes are available on the NBC Web site:\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/3_5_Initiation.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/3_20_Safety_Training.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Michael takes the staff of the upper office into the warehouse to hear Darryl\\'s presentation on warehouse safety.

In a talking head interview, Darryl reveals that he is on crutches because Michael pulled a ladder out from under him as a joke. The office and warehouse staff then head upstairs, where Toby reads office safety tips from a book as Michael frequently interrupts and insults him. Bored with the presentation and of Michael, the warehouse staff depart, and Michael and Darryl exchange words, with Darryl calling Michael\\'s life and job completely safe like \"Nerf.\"\\nMeanwhile, the entire office staff begins betting on various things, a trend started by Kevin, who is bored since March Madness has ended and he has nothing to bet on. On one bet, Jim, Kevin, Karen, and Oscar bet on how many jelly beans are in Pam\\'s candy dish. Kevin loses to Jim and calls this unfair since Jim has spent \"hours\" standing at Pam\\'s desk. A look of discomfort spreads across Karen\\'s face when she hears this. Other bets include guessing how long Kelly can talk about Netflix (Ryan wins), how many times she says awesome (twelve times, Pam wins), how many romantic comedies she mentions (six times, Jim wins). The final bet is whether Creed will notice if someone switches his apple with a potato. Karen loses every bet and gets cleaned out.\\nOffended by Darryl\\'s comments, Michael decides to show them that working in an office is dangerous because the stress of office life can lead to depression and suicide. Michael plans to demonstrate the dangers of depression by jumping off the roof and secretly landing on a trampoline. However, when he and Dwight test the trampoline by tossing a watermelon, the watermelon bounces off, landing on Stanley\\'s car, so they replace the trampoline with a bouncy castle. Dwight calls the office and warehouse staff to the parking lot, where they see Michael standing on the roof, talking about the dangers of depression. Initially, they do not take Michael seriously, but then they find the bouncy castle and realize that it was a joke. But then Jim and Pam realize that Michael will be hurt badly if he actually jumps, and they try to get him down to no avail. Darryl talks Michael out of his fake \"suicide attempt\", by convincing him that he is braver than Darryl.\\nAt the end of the day, Stanley is shocked when he sees his car covered in watermelon from Michael\\'s test.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/3_20_Safety_Training.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/5_21_Two_Weeks.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Having submitted his two weeks notice to Dunder Mifflin, Michael begins goofing off and drinking around the office, while new company vice president Charles Miner plans to hire the new regional manager from the outside, for \"obvious reasons.\" The employees suggest that Michael start looking for another job.

In his office, Andy spots a raccoon eating a hamburger in the parking lot and excitedly (and silently) attempts to tell his employees. Kevin opens the wrapper of his candy bar and as he eats it, he exclaims, \"Oh yeah,\" breaking the silent streak. Oscar berates Kevin on his need to vocalize his phrase while Jim proposes that the entire office attempt to beat the record of twenty minutes after they have let out as much speaking as possible. Andy finally informs the office about the raccoon, Dwight tells Jim that the banging of his pen against his desk irritates Dwight, Erin asks the office if a first-aid kit is available for the noticeable cut on her hand and Darryl showcases a new song that he has written. The scene concludes with Jim counting down to restart the silent streak challenge.\\nAndy, who is worried that he will not be able to meet the 8% quarterly sales growth figures that Robert California asked for by $830, starts to think of creative ways to sell more paper. During a conference room meeting, he proposes that everyone in the office buy paper to alleviate some of the burden, but no one is willing. He then decides to ask Oscar to make a rounding mistake in the books, but Oscar tells Andy that he does not have time to make the mistake because he is leaving for a trivia contest in a bar in Philadelphia. He tells Andy that the prize is $1000 and his team is determined to win it. Andy, encouraged by Darryl and Jim, decides to take the entire office to Philadelphia in an attempt to win the money and make up the sales growth difference. At the bar, which turns out to be a gay bar called the Liberty Well, Andy divides the office into three teams: Dunder Mifflin A-Team (Jim, Darryl, Andy, and Ryan), Dunder-Mifflin B-Team (Stanley, Phyllis, Creed, and Cathy), and the \"Just For Fun\" team (Kevin, Kelly, Erin, and Meredith). Oscar refuses to join Andy and stays on his original team. Initially, the Dunder Mifflin A-Team does well until they soon falter. However, much to Andy\\'s surprise, the \"Just For Fun\" team (calling themselves The Einsteins) ends up doing much better than expected because of the group\\'s trivial knowledge on a variety of issues. Humorously, the team misses the answers to a handful of common questions, including one about their namesake. They make it to the final round against Oscar\\'s team and eventually win thanks to Kevin\\'s correct answers. However, the Just for Fun team\\'s luck runs out when they later get demolished while trying to win another bar\\'s even more lucrative trivia contest.\\nMeanwhile, Dwight heads down to Florida to meet with Robert California at the Sabre headquarters to discuss a possible manager position. While sitting in the waiting room, Dwight talks to Gabe, who describes himself as the \"toilet of the company\" who flushes all the unwanted items away. Robert then tells Dwight that he cannot meet with him but will have him meet with Bill, another executive, much to Dwight\\'s frustration. However, Robert manipulates the situation by secretly calling Gabe and instructing him to not let Dwight speak with Bill either, but to have Gabe listen to Dwight\\'s pitch and then reject him. Dwight, after being told by Gabe that he is not wanted as a manager, grabs and twists Gabe\\'s arm and forces him to be taken to Robert\\'s Florida condo. Initially, Robert tries to spare Dwight\\'s feelings, but eventually turns him down by telling him he\\'s a better salesman and his drive and energy would be wasted in a manager\\'s position. Dwight then returns to Scranton.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/8_11_Trivia.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/2_7_The_Client.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Michael and Jan take a client to Chili\\'s for an important meeting.

Afterwards in the parking lot, Michael and recently divorced Jan share a kiss.\\nMeanwhile, Pam finds a screenplay written by Michael, and Jim leads the office staff in a table read of the script. An editing error in the script reveals that Michael based the incompetent sidekick on Dwight, who quickly shuts down the exercise to invite everyone to set off fireworks outside. Jim and Pam break off their respective evening plans to enjoy an impromptu dinner on the roof and watch the firework show, followed by swaying to music on his iPod. The next day, Jim makes a joke about their \"first date\", and Pam is too quick to tell him bluntly it was not a date, and that swaying is not dancing. Jim makes a snide comment about Roy and Pam\\'s first date, at which he left her at a hockey game. Pam is offended by his comment and walks away.\\nThe following morning, Dwight (who has slept in the office) and Angela independently observe Jan returning to her car (still parked at Dunder Mifflin), and word quickly travels around the office. Michael initially tells the documentary crew that \"nothing happened,\" that they talked for several hours before falling asleep, but his story gradually changes to imply that they did more than just talk.

Jim doesn't want Michael there because he wants the employees to feel free to have fun. Besides, his roommate doesn't believe Dwight actually exists. To get Dwight to stay quiet, he claimed the party was actually a surprise party for Michael.\\nFinally, Michael decides he is just going to go to his Improv class. Michael's not very good at Improv. He repeatedly ruins his classmates' scenes by resorting to his sole character: a gun-wielding action hero. The teacher is unable to get him to cooperate. When the class goes to dinner together after their session, they do not include Michael.

Instead, someone took it upon themselves to alert the media which has caused a massive PR problem for the company. She wants to know who it was. Because Andy found out about the problem first, most of the employees believe he\\'s the responsible person. Jo decides to start at the top and pulls Michael into the conference room to interrogate him. She has always believed that an innocent person would recommend a harsh punishment, while a guilty person would be more sympathetic. To Jo\\'s satisfaction, Michael insists on a heavy punishment for the whistleblower, but is also adamant that none of his people would have leaked the story.\\nDwight refuses to waste any time. He immediately denies responsibility and gives Jo a long list of people she should fire, satisfying her. Changing the subject, she mentions his very profitable year. Dwight doesn\\'t have any real ideas as to where to do next. She strongly suggests he invest in real estate. After a lot of consideration, Dwight attempts to buy the Scranton Business Park and suggests in a conversation with Hank the security guard that he will implement sweeping changes to the place.\\nMeanwhile, while Sabre\\'s IT guy, Nick, checks everyone\\'s computers for evidence, Michael is pressured by the others to get Andy to confess. Andy points out that Darryl was just as upset about the issue. Michael is stunned when after being confronted, Darryl admits to disclosing the information to a woman at a bar who turned out to be a journalist. Pam also confesses to Jim that she mentioned it in casual conversation with another mother at the day-care center whose husband also happened to be a journalist. When she confesses to Michael, he asks her and Darryl to meet him in Meredith\\'s van. Kelly joins them as she also revealed the news on Twitter out of boredom. The three suggest to Michael that he should try to talk to Jo about the situation so that they can confess without losing their jobs.\\nWhen Michael changes his tune about harshly punishing the whistleblower, Jo realizes that he knows who it is. He refuses to name names so Jo takes him to her private plane and changes tactics. He admits his life hasn\\'t been great this year. Besides the many small things that have made him realize he\\'s not satisfied, he desperately misses Holly. Jo opens up about how she\\'d always dreamed of being a powerful woman who could set an example for young girls. Instead, she\\'s going to be remembered as someone who sells cheap printers that burst into flames. There\\'s a press release that someone will have to read and she\\'s dreading having to do it. Michael offers to \"fall on his sword\" and announce the public apology for her.\\nBack at the office, Gabe finishes interviewing everyone and deduces that Andy is the one who talked with the press. Everyone tries to suggest that it could be someone else, perhaps even Gabe. At that moment, Nick suddenly announces that he is quitting to go teach inner-city children in Detroit how to use computers. The employees don\\'t even know his name and aren\\'t interested in his news. In retaliation, Nick reveals all their private information he found on their computers, including the Quicktime video Andy shot with Darryl and a message he emailed to a local newspaper.\\nAt the end of the day, Andy finds himself harassed by the other employees.

All agree, although Michael misreads a sarcastic Angela who says she supports protecting a criminal, especially as a \"90 lb. female who sits in a poorly-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office\".\\nMeanwhile, Andy dials Jim\\'s extension and whispers \"I\\'m horny\". Jim is flabbergasted but soon realizes Andy wants a rundown on his attractive female coworkers and asks for a debriefing on Kelly, Angela and Pam. Jim encourages Andy to pursue Pam and as a prank, coaches him on her favorite things. In actuality, his tips are things that Pam hates: frisbee-based competitions, hunting, pig Latin, and the Six Flags television commercial \"with the old guy\".\\nDwight assures Michael he is of a collected, cool mindset to hear a piece of news, but when told of Martin\\'s criminal past attempts to take off in a dead sprint. In an interview he says he simply doesn\\'t like criminals. Michael himself announces Martin\\'s \"problems with Johnny Law\" to everyone, and says that for every trusted white man, he can name a black man he trusts more. He then asks employees to call out names of white men. He tops Pam\\'s father with \"Danny Glover\", but is unfamiliar with Jim\\'s suggestion of \"Jonas Salk\"; Jim quickly substitutes Justin Timberlake, which garners \"Colin Powell\". Karen suggests \"Jesus\", to which the boss replies \"Apollo Creed\" to which Stanley simply rolls his eyes in casual disbelief.\\nIn the breakroom over lunch, Martin tells the others he was incarcerated for insider trading, and although it was routine and could be dull, he enjoyed certain perks of prison, including outside time and art classes. Ryan is told about prison business classes taught by Harvard Business School guys. Pam comments that prison sounds better than their current work situation and Kevin wonders why the branch doesn\\'t receive daily outdoors time.\\nSoon, Michael announces an hour outdoors time will take place in the parking lot. Nearly everyone heads outside to bitter cold temperatures. Michael offers a weightlifting session with a 2.5\\xa0lb. dumbbell he produces from the trunk of his Sebring, but a freezing Stanley leads a charge back into the warmth of the office.\\nMichael soon calls an impromptu meeting in which he dons a do-rag and attempts to \"scare you straight\" as an ex-con character named \"Prison Mike\". He speaks with a New York accent, calls Angela a bee-yoch, threatens to shove her up against a wall (and incites Dwight to politely come to her defense with the rest of the staff), says life \"in the clink\" is no picnic, alludes to violence and rape and singles out Ryan because, in prison, he would be \"da belle of da ball\", who responds \"Michael, please\" in total discomfort.\\nJim asks Prison Mike where he learned such information and he claims it\\'s a mix of the Internet and prison. Jim asks his crime and Angela is peeved when Dwight asks Prison Mike the worst thing about prison, which he responds by claiming there were Dementors. Andy plays along, and says prison sounds awful. Prison Mike concludes his speech, saying \"You got a good life.\" Martin comments that Michael\\'s performance did not remind him of his time in prison. A frustrated Michael locks everyone in the conference room, who become concerned and begin moving around for an exit. Hannah, still at her desk with the pink-clothed child, ignores Kevin\\'s pleas for assistance.\\nPam phones Toby who tells Michael the staff is fully aware a workplace is better than prison and are simply teasing him.

She smiles politely and glances at Jim, who gives the camera his trademark smirk.\\nIn response to Martin\\'s account of prison life, some of the employees playfully suggest that prison is better than Dunder Mifflin. Taking the remark personally, Michael summons the employees to a meeting in the conference room.\\nAfter a brief introduction, Michael\\'s Prison Mike persona emerges. Wearing a purple bandana over his head, briefly exhibiting an eye deformity (presumably due to fighting), speaking in a caricature of New York English and adopting the role of a convict, he says he came because there had been \"a lot of fun talk about prison,\" but that he was there to scare everyone straight. Michael came up with the idea of Prison Mike in his improv class.\\nIn his Prison Mike persona, Michael paints an awful, and somewhat fanciful, picture of prison life. He states that he learned about prison life from the internet and from prison itself, 50/50. Prison described by Michael in his \"Prison Mike\" persona involves such colorful elements as the dementors of Harry Potter, a diet of gruel—gruel sandwiches and gruel omelets—and chain gangs. Sex—with inmates or guards—is compulsory, there are no movies and you can\\'t go home, \"recharge your batteries,\" and come back the next day to be with your friends, having fun in office. Michael is somewhat vague about Prison Mike\\'s criminal background, except for a claim that he had stolen, robbed, and kidnapped the President\\'s son for ransom, but \"never got caught\".\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/3_9_The_Convict.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/8_14_Special_Project.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Just as Pam\\'s maternity leave ends, Dwight is assigned the task of forming a team and traveling down to Florida for three weeks to help Sabre launch a chain of retail stores.

Michael wants everyone to think of the outing as a day off — except for Pam, whom he directs to take detailed notes on each participant\\'s behavior and skills. He takes all the employees with him except Toby, telling the camera that the beach trip also serves as the last great memory for the employees of their time spent with Michael—which Toby\\'s very presence would ruin (for Michael).\\nAs they arrive, Michael starts the activities by selecting four employees \"at random\" to lead different \"tribes\": Jim, Dwight, Andy, and Stanley. The choices were actually deliberate, as they are Michael\\'s considerations for his successor. He explains their pros and cons to the camera: Jim has a great personality but doesn\\'t work hard (since he can finish a project in 30 minutes while the same project takes Michael all day); Dwight is enthusiastic but \"an idiot\"; Andy \"gets\" Michael, but he doesn\\'t trust Andy; Stanley represents the \"amazing progress of African-Americans.\" They form different tribes: \"Team Gryffindor,\" led by Dwight, \"Team Voldemort,\" led by Jim and named in direct opposition to Dwight, \"Blue Team,\" led by Stanley, and \"Team U.S.A.,\" led by Andy.\\nThe activities begin with the employees oblivious to Michael\\'s true intentions. In an egg race, Jim tricks a blindfolded Karen into stepping into the nearby lake; Dwight is overly commanding of Ryan; Andy can\\'t stop Kelly from removing her blindfold, and Stanley sits out in his customary apathy. As Pam takes notes for him, Michael grows frustrated with the contestants\\' failure to stick to his plans. He has Pam prepare a hot dog eating contest (giving her about 10 minutes to prepare eight hundred wieners), but when the employees balk, an exasperated Michael reveals his upcoming interview, and that the winner of the games would replace him. Realizing Michael\\'s seriousness, the four tribe leaders (except for Jim) decide to step up their efforts; even Stanley, since he would detest working for anyone else in the office. Andy wins the hot dog eating contest. Creed returns to the group after eating a raw fish which he caught with his bare hands, unaware that food was going to be provided by Michael.\\nPrivately, Dwight and Angela plan to sabotage events by having Angela, who is on Andy\\'s team, pretend to mishear everything that Andy says. Michael reveals the next event to be mock sumo wrestling, using the large movement-limiting costumes common to amusement park-style, recreational sumo wrestling. Dwight emerges victorious, and, as planned, Angela pretends not to hear Andy\\'s direction, even when he slips into the lake in his buoyant costume and begins drifting downstream. Away from the others, Karen and Jim phone headquarters, both making appointments for the same open interview that Michael was invited to. Also, in a talking head segment, Oscar states that he intends to break up with his partner, Gil. He adds that he may (with Angela\\'s encouragement) experiment with heterosexual relationships, although it\\'s not immediately clear if he is serious about that part.\\nMichael reveals his final event: a walk across hot coals. He decides to walk across the coals himself, but ultimately never takes the first step after much procrastination. Shockingly, Pam wants to try the challenge herself, but Michael stops her since she is not one of the candidates, to her protest. He asks Jim to walk across the coals, but he refuses because he doesn\\'t want to burn his feet. Dwight, in an attempt to both impress and blackmail Michael into giving him the position, steps onto the coals and says he will stay there until he gets the job, at which point his feet begin to burn, and he begins to collapse until he is practically lying on top of the coals in pain while the staff rushes to help him.\\nOnce Dwight is removed from the pit, Michael, again unhappy with the results thus far, announces a sudden death — \"Tribal Council\" — stand-up comedy event. Andy is still adrift in the water on his back before a light shines on him and he calls for help but is still ignored. Jim again declines to participate and reveals that he is going to New York City for the open interviews at corporate. Pam, still at the coals, decides to run across barefoot. Empowered by the experience, she interrupts the Tribal Council with her newfound confidence. She expresses her disappointment that (almost) no one attended her art show (months earlier) despite being invited, and that they sometimes act as if she doesn\\'t exist. She then directs herself to Jim and publicly reveals that she called off her wedding because of him, explaining that she had plenty of reasons not to be with Roy, but ignored them until she met Jim. Saying that it\\'s \"fine\" that he\\'s with someone else now, she states that she simply misses him and the fun that they had as best friends before he left for the Stamford branch, and then decides she needs to walk in the water to cool her feet. While the rest of the staff sits in awkward silence and Jim sits there completely stunned from what he just heard, Michael is impressed but reiterates that he is looking for a replacement with sales experience.\\nThe episode ends with footage of the staff on the bus earlier that\\xa0day, singing the theme song to The Flintstones with Michael providing sound effects before shouting \"WILMA!\" at the end of the song.\\nThe Season Three DVD contains a number of deleted scenes.

Jim reassures Andy that he managed to pick up sales, and that no one in the office expects him to go through with the tattoo idea. Andy responds by getting the tattoo, which Pam changes, without telling Andy, to an image of a dog that has \"Nard\" written on it, a reference to Andy\\'s nickname \"Nard Dog.\" Upon seeing his completed tattoo in a mirror, Andy is pleased with the result. Robert then reveals to the cameras that he picked Andy because he is \"all surface...uncomplicated, what you see is what you get\" and that causes people to rally behind him, because he is an underdog.\\nMeanwhile, Pam and Angela become walking buddies at Angela\\'s request, but after Angela says she\\'s reported Pam to Social Services for drinking herbal tea with traces of caffeine it, a disgusted Pam tells Angela they should not have anything else to do with each other.

In a talking head, Michael reveals that \"One more thing I did over the summer...

Left with no option, Michael confesses that Luke is his nephew, to the outrage of the office. Oscar points out that giving Luke special treatment is nepotism and unfair to everyone. Michael then compares himself to how God \"hired\" his son Jesus to be a religious figure, asking \"why does God get to do something that I don\\'t?\" Oscar continues to point out the flaws in Michael\\'s logic, and asks Michael why he would have hidden this from them if he himself did not think there was something wrong.

After text messaging Dwight, she boards the elevator to show him \"something in the lobby,\" but the plan backfires when they become trapped in the elevator due to the rewiring. Dwight starts to urinate in the elevator, which he states is due to all the water he has been drinking.\\nWhen Luke continues to irritate the office, Michael gets fed up and repeatedly spanks him in front of the entire office. Luke runs away crying and quits his job, with the rest of the office satisfied that Luke will no longer be a problem to them.\\nPeople from building maintenance are called in to get Dwight and Pam out of the elevator. As it lowers to ground level, Jim is impressed with the prank Pam pulled on Dwight, even though it had the opposite effect that Pam intended.\\nIn the final scene, Gabe informs Michael that because he spanked Luke (which was \"physical assault\" of an employee) he must either have a counseling session or be fired immediately. Michael takes the former option happily, but after finding out that the session will be with Toby, he pauses and reconsiders being fired instead.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/7_1_Nepotism.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/5_18_Blood_Drive.md'}\ndoc: page_content='It\\'s Valentine\\'s Day at the office. Michael and Kevin enter the building in bad spirits over the holiday because they are single. Michael even goes as far as to put Pam\\'s flowers behind her desk. When Jim and Pam object, Michael tells them they are being insensitive by \"flaunting\"\\xa0their romantic happiness in everyone\\'s faces\\xa0and announces that there will be a party for singles only where they will meet in defiance of love. As they can\\'t attend the party for singles, Jim and Pam agree to join Phyllis and Bob Vance for a two-hour lunch - which Phyllis explains they will be able to take due to Michael\\'s fear of Bob.\\nMichael meets a woman at a Valentine\\'s Day blood drive where they have a good conversation. However, Michael passes out after his blood is drawn and the woman is gone when he comes to. He finds a glove, thinking it is hers. At the \"Lonely Hearts Party,\" Michael gets the office workers to share break up stories. When asked about her relationship with Ryan, Kelly initially claims that Ryan\\'s “heart was in the right place”, but seems very downtrodden when Michael points out Ryan is now in Thailand having \"random sex.\" \\nOscar shares a story about how he took a chance and confessed his romantic feelings to another man only for the man to tell him that he was not gay. Oscar then mentions how his friend called him later and told him about how he saw\\xa0Oscar\\'s crush at a gay bar, showing that the man was gay and lied to Oscar to avoid dating him (though Michael interprets this as a happy ending as the man did turn out to be gay). \\nAngela relates how her worst breakup was with two men who dueled over her and then both left her. When Oscar names the two men as Dwight and Andy, Angela claims that this was when she was in Ohio, with the two men being John Mark and John David, leaving Oscar to bewilderingly point out that she has had two different pairs of men physically duel over her. \\nKevin tells the story of how Stacy left him, with them eating breakfast one day while Kevin read the sports section of the newspaper. When Kevin stated his belief that the Philadelphia Eagles might clinch the NFC East, Stacy replied: \"We\\'re done.\" Kevin\\'s story so shocks and saddens Michael that he states that rather than sitting around sharing sad stories of broken romances they should try to go out and meet people, declaring that they will turn their anti-romance party into a Single\\'s Mixer. \\nMichael puts out fliers advertising the mixer,\\xa0with a special note at the bottom mentioning the glove he found, making clear his plans to try to meet the woman he donated blood with again by returning her glove.\\xa0At the mixer, Michael makes attempts to introduce his employees to new party-comers, introducing a dye and repair worker to Meredith and introducing Kevin to\\xa0Lynn. Dwight begins talking to Lynn\\'s friend (who is a small blonde woman similar in appearance to Angela) but quickly switches from romance to business when he learns she works at a catalog company that uses a lot of paper. Dwight notices that Michael constantly is glancing at the door and asks if he is expecting someone, leading Michael to reveal how he is trying to return the glove of the woman he donated blood with. Kelly is charmed by Michael\\'s story, comparing it to a modern-day fairy tale.\\xa0\\nAs the party goes on, Kevin offhandedly\\xa0mentions to Lynn how his fiancé left him, causing him to believe he blew his chance with her. However, as Lynn gets ready to leave, Kevin approaches her and asks for her email address, which she gives, causing Kevin to tell the camera that it was a good Valentine\\'s Day. The blonde Dwight is talking to leaves after refusing Dwight\\'s business, causing him to shout at her angrily as he leaves. Michael continues waiting and the other employees decide to wait with Michael also. As it becomes clear however that the woman is not coming, Kelly gently urges Michael to accept it and leave. In the parking lot the employees, sensing Michael\\'s heartbreak, each warmly bid him goodnight before leaving, leading Michael to say that despite the woman not coming he\\'s happy enough to have friends like them.\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, Jim and Pam are having an enjoyable conversation with Phyllis and Bob, until the latter couple does not return from the bathroom. The food has arrived and Jim and Pam, tired of waiting, start to pick food from Phyllis and Bob\\'s plates. As Pam is reaching for another bite Jim scares her by exclaiming, \"here they come.\" Pam then asks if Phyllis and Bob dined and dashed to which Jim replies that they didn\\'t dine so that is unlikely. Pam is worried that Phyllis and Bob weren\\'t having a good time, so therefore they left. They then decide to check the bathroom and hear Phyllis and Bob having sex in the handicap bathroom. After Phyllis and Bob return to the table (clearly sweaty and out of breath from their intercourse) Jim and Pam awkwardly watch as Bob seductively feeds Phyllis a piece of his steak.\\xa0\\nThe episode ends with a scene that presumably happened earlier in the day. Stanley tries to get a cookie from the blood drive van saying he wants another one after giving blood. The nurse notices that he has a cotton ball and tape on his arm and tells him that they have been using band-aids. Stanley acts confused and leaves the van when he runs into Phyllis (also sporting a cotton ball and tape)\\xa0and quietly says, \"band-aids\", to which Phyllis replies, \"damn it.\" The camera then focuses on Creed leaving the blood drive van while slyly slipping a blood bag into his pocket.\\xa0\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/5_18_Blood_Drive.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/7_15_The_Search.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Michael continues to try to ask Holly to get back together with him, but she continually refuses, stating she doesn\\'t want a relationship with someone she works with again.

While at a gas station, Jim gets a call from Pam\\'s mother Helene, who was taking a feverish Cece to see the doctor when she accidentally locked the child in the car. Jim leaves to attend to Cece, but not before attempting in vain to tell Michael through the door of the bathroom; he also tells a man in coveralls to tell Michael what happened, but the man is a customer rather than a gas station employee and drives away. Michael is left at the gas station with no way of contacting the office, as his cell phone and wallet are with Jim and he doesn\\'t remember the office\\'s number, so he ends up wandering around Scranton and making stops at a pet store and a hot dog stand.\\nJim, now with Cece, calls Pam and tells her Michael is at the gas station, so Holly and Erin plan to head out to look for Michael before Dwight insults them both and says that he\\'ll lead the expedition. Dwight and Erin are rude to Holly, but when Dwight suggests that Michael walked back to the office, Holly correctly guesses that he went in the direction of the bakery next door \"just for the smell of it.\" After stopping at a grocery store to get some things for Pam, Dwight and Erin notice Holly changing cell phone services at a kiosk outside the store. They and the kiosk attendant are annoyed to discover that Holly used a joke name to complete the forms in order to get a rubber stress ball, but when the attendant mentions that someone else had done the exact thing earlier, Dwight and Erin recognize a fake name that is used by Michael. Believing that Holly can subconsciously determine where Michael has been, they follow her to a Chinese restaurant, where they find his picture on the wall along with others who have dined there without paying (Creed also being among them, twice).\\nMichael eventually runs away from the camera crew so they can\\'t find him. Dwight demands Holly to tell him where Michael is, but Holly says she doesn\\'t know. She suggests that they find a high vantage point at which they can try to spot him, but Dwight rejects this idea, and the two split up. Holly walks away while Dwight decides to look in a bowling alley. Holly heads up to the roof of a tall building to see if she can spot Michael from above. On the roof, she finds Michael who was similarly trying to spot the office from above. They both admit that they\\'ve missed each other and kiss. Erin, who opted to follow Holly instead of Dwight, walks in and is happy for Michael.\\nMeanwhile, Pam notices her Sabre printer doodle on the refrigerator has funny captions that insult Sabre, and she gets the office to participate in a caption contest involving a cartoon of two dogs on a tropical island. Gabe, who finds the captions insulting, implements a list of annoying rules, stating that they can\\'t insult Sabre or use pop culture references, and that they have to use new Sabre \"sticky quips\". The office instead decides to use an instant messenger to share quips. Gabe catches them and prints out the list of quips and reads them to the office, which start off insulting Sabre before they attack Gabe personally. The favored entry involves one where one of the dogs says he\\'s going to piss on one of the palm trees because it reminds him of Gabe; an interview reveals that Angela came up with that one. The office continues to get good laughs out of the ones that insult Gabe, who is once again defeated and miserable.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/7_15_The_Search.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/9_14_Vandalism.md'}\ndoc: page_content=\"Erin helps Darryl sneak out of the office early.

The three eventually find out that the criminal was a warehouse worker named Frank. Pam and Dwight take revenge by painting childish pictures on his beloved truck with washable paint. However, Frank overreacts and begins to show signs that he is going to physically assault Pam. Brian, the documentary crew's boom mic operator, breaks protocol and intervenes by hitting the warehouse employee across the face with his mic. In the end, the audience learns that both Frank and Brian have been fired from Dunder Mifflin and the documentary, respectively. As Brian leaves, he tells Pam that he will always be there for her if she needs someone.\\nMeanwhile, in their Philadelphia apartment, Darryl is uncomfortable with Jim's lack of cleanliness. After Jim accidentally uses Darryl's labeled coffee mug, the two begin bickering; both feel that the other is being unreasonable. Eventually, Jim decides to try and make an effort to keep the apartment clean, and Darryl tries not to be so retentive about the cleanliness of his things.\\nAngela and Robert Lipton celebrate their son Phillip's first birthday. Angela is shocked to learn that Robert invited Oscar to the party, even though she told Robert she didn't want him there. Angela invites Dwight, but after he refuses, Angela then invites Kevin, both in retaliation and to keep him from being alone with the office's accounts. Oscar, who believes he is invited because he thinks Robert is in love with him, soon realizes that he was only invited to boost Robert's opinion in the polls among Latino voters. After the party Kevin thanks Angela and Robert for the food, but tells Robert that he is a terrible person for using his friends to gain political support.\\n\" metadata={'source': '../working/9_14_Vandalism.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/3_4_Grief_Counseling.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Michael flips through his Rolodex and starts to flirt with Jan on the phone after she tells him \"We\\'ve lost Ed Truck.\" He is shaken to learn Jan hasn\\'t lost a contact number, but that the former Scranton branch manager has died.

She is angered when Josh asks Jim to ensure she completes the task. Jim agrees and Andy calls him a suck-up in a barely disguised cough.

He counters that he does have that power, and no work shall be completed until the chips she requires are procured.\\nMichael makes a comment on Creed\\'s age, but the mood changes when Creed mentions Truck was decapitated after flying down Route 6, drunk as a skunk and sliding his vehicle beneath an 18-wheeler. Dwight steals Michael\\'s thunder with a blunt announcement of the latest news. Dwight receives only disgust from his \"Monkey\" when he asks her to pack his decapitated head on ice should that fate ever befall him.

Expounding on his feeling at the loss of his beloved ex-boss, he says it \"feels like my heart has been dropped into a bucket of boiling tears and someone else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer and a third guy is punching me in the griefbone, but no one hears me because I\\'m terribly, terribly alone.\"\\nRoy pulls Pam from the session under the pretense of addressing a problem with her car. In the parking lot, Pam and Roy have a banal chat about her car\\'s airbags and he asks if she\\'s \"still driving too fast.\" Upon her return to the grief session, she finds Michael had put the whole thing on hold because \"we wait for a family member.\" Stanley refuses to play Michael\\'s grief game but Dwight gladly tells the group he resorbed another fetus while still in the womb, making him as strong as a man combined with a baby. Pam, Ryan, and Kevin tell progressively implausible stories based on movie plots, angering Michael when he realizes what they are doing.\\nToby tells Michael death is a part of life, and uses an example of a bird that flew into a Dunder Mifflin first-floor window that morning.

Michael gives Kevin a caricature of Kevin as a pig drooling over a pizza. Michael then rips it up, telling Kevin not to be a caricature. Michael gives Oscar a self-made scarecrow.

It is clear that Michael has invested emotionally in these kids, knowing their names, going to their plays and other activities and even had a reading room at the school named after him. Michael heads into the classroom, and sees people clapping for him.\\nMichael is then given a presentation where a bunch of the \"tots\" are thanking them because they are going to graduate this year. They sing an impromptu song, and Michael awkwardly claps, but begins to realize the scope of his promise. A teacher calls Michael a dream-maker and gets emotional. A kid tells Michael that he wants to be a president and also tells Michael that he is his hero. Michael starts to cry. Michael stands up and tries to tell the tots that he cannot pay for their tuition, however, they take it as a joke. When Michael insists that he cannot pay for the tuition, they become extremely angry. Michael offers them lithium computer batteries instead. \\nMeanwhile, Dwight goes up to Kevin and Oscar and collects twenty dollars from each of them for the employee of the month award, which Jim had never agreed upon. When the time comes to pull the number, he ends up pulling his own. He tries to explain it was a mistake as he cannot be the Employee of the Month, then draws Pam\\'s number next. Pam has no problem believing she deserves the award as she\\'s doubled her sales from two to four. The others protest what they believe is a rigged process in the Helperts\\' favor.

Michael explains that he hired Kevin as an accountant, even when he applied in the warehouse because he had a \"feeling about him\". Michael then tells Erin that he has a feeling about her too, and the two begin to sing \"Hey Mr. Scott\" for the rest of the ride.\\nRyan finds a copy of the Diabolical Plan in the copier and tells Dwight he wants to take down Jim Halpert.

Flood Elementary was not just the customary gathering of community professionals talking about their line of work and offering guidance to spry youngsters. Local employees and business owners were in attendance, and several speeches were given. But one person outshone the rest by offering much more than a mere presentation about his career. Michael G. Scott, Regional Manager at Dunder Mifflin, is a modest guy who likes to wear jeans, cherishes his \"World’s Best Boss\" mug, and lacks a college education. He thought about playing for the NHL, but decided against it because he wanted to settle down with a family. And although he may not have that family yet, he has offered his leadership and his pocketbook to 15 third graders with dreams of going to college someday — something Scott never had the chance to do.\\n\"I\\'ve fallen in love with these cherubs, and I don\\'t want them to become victims of the system,” Scott said. \"I told them if they graduated high school, I would pay for their college educations.\" \"Scott\\'s Tot\\'s\" may have been a program started impulsively, but Scott doesn\\'t regret it. \"Just seeing the sunshine spurting out of the kids\\' and parents\\' faces,\" he said, \"is enough for me to keep the program going for years. I bet if colleges saw that, they\\'d let them in for free. Hmm, maybe I should make some phone calls.\"\\nTalib Johnson, a student in Alice Kay\\'s class, has dreams of becoming a doctor. Talib\\'s mother has already been trying to save for the daunting $120,000 dollar cost of medical school, and she was not sure if it would ever be a reality. But now that Scott has offered to pick up the tab, Mrs. Johnson said that Talib would undoubtedly be going to an Ivy League university. Scott was impressed, but encouraged Talib to consider the paper business.\\nScott\\'s Tots in third grade.Mikela Lasker has aspirations of becoming a veterinarian. \"I really love science and animals, and I want to take care of sick ones,\" she said. Just like Talib\\'s mother, Mikela\\'s parents were concerned about the high price of veterinary school. \"She\\'s got to get a bachelor\\'s degree first, and then go on to vet school,\" Mr. Lasker said. \"Her mother and I have tried to save, but we both really enjoy drinking Italian wine, and that takes a huge chunk out of our weekly income.\"\\nBut now, thanks to Scott, the Laskers can continue to indulge in spirits, carefree. Scott was very surprised to learn that Mikela\\'s veterinary degree would have to be earned separately from her undergraduate degree. When asked if he would be willing to foot the bill for postgraduate education as well, Scott at first seemed hesitant, but then replied with, \"Sure, what the hell.\"\\nFor quotes see: Scott\\'s Tots Quotes.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/6_12_Scott%27s_Tots.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/8_22_Fundraiser.md'}\ndoc: page_content='In order to appear sophisticated, Ryan pretends to be \"completely devastated\" about Smokey Robinson\\'s death.

They try to persuade Ryan to buy tickets, but upon learning how expensive it is, Ryan makes excuses why he can\\'t go.\\nAngela excitedly tells the cameras about how her husband, \"The Senator\", is hosting a fundraiser for dogs, and Robert California has purchased two tables for the entire office staff. Dwight comes in warning the office that they are all about to be murdered, as Andy is sitting in his car in the parking lot. Dwight believes that Andy is seeking revenge and may go on a shooting spree. Jim, Pam, Erin and Kevin go down to the parking lot to check on Andy, but he is merely there to pick up Erin and that he is going to be her date to the fundraiser the office staff are attending. Meanwhile, Nellie tries to bond with Darryl, but fails to connect with him. She tells the documentary crew that she will try to connect with him at the fundraiser.\\nAndy arrives at the fundraiser and shares a brief and awkward reunion with the office staff. When asked how he is doing, Andy talks about a rock opera he is writing and most of the staff write him off as \"on the brink of a breakdown\". Andy becomes excited about this idea and starts singing, annoying many of the guests. Robert believes that Andy made a mistake by coming and offers him money to take Erin out to a nice romantic dinner, but Andy refuses. Robert then kicks Andy out of the group, and Andy is forced to purchase a whole table to stay.\\nOscar becomes excited when Angela\\'s husband appears to flirt with him and gives him his cell phone number. Oscar excitedly tells Pam and Jim about it. Pam seems excited, but Jim is skeptical and thinks that he was just schmoozing with voters. Jim decides to go talk to Senator Lipton and see if he gives his number out to everybody. \\nThe guests participate in a silent auction. However, Dwight believes it is a \"Guess the Price\" game and puts down extremely high bids. Kevin finds it amusing that Dwight is the \"idiot of the office\" and that before that \"they didn\\'t have one\".\\nJim succeeds in getting The Senator\\'s number and Oscar and Pam tease him that The Senator probably thinks he is gay.\\nNellie tries to bond with Darryl again by talking about American food. Darryl realizes that Nellie has no idea what tacos are and offers to go buy some. Nellie offers to pay for them, and after realizing that she has no idea how much they cost, Darryl takes more than they really cost.\\nWhile Andy is participating in the silent auction he runs into David Wallace. The two catch each other up on events and David Wallace reveals that his vacuum cleaner toy \"Suck It!\" was sold to the military for $20 million. David tells Andy to forget about Dunder Mifflin.\\nRobert gives a speech on how the fundraiser\\'s purpose is to raise money to take care of elderly or disabled dogs and explains how the dogs are all unlikely to ever find homes. Andy, in an attempt to outdo Robert, offers to adopt all 12. Robert tries to stop Andy, but Andy gives his own speech about how he is actually doing something for the dogs and ends up making a fool of himself.\\nDarryl returns with tacos and watches in amusement as Nellie attempts to eat it by shoveling the filling out of the shell into her mouth. However, Darryl decides to stop pranking her upon realizing that she is really trying to be friends.\\nAndy realizes that all the dogs he has adopted are all very needy dogs due to their various conditions. Jim, Pam, Erin, and Kevin come to comfort Andy and assure him that his life will get better.\\nOscar is disappointed that the Senator isn\\'t interested in him, but as he leaves the Senator shakes Oscar\\'s hand and reminds him to call. He ends the hand shake by awkwardly stroking Oscar\\'s arm and Oscar becomes very excited, as he takes it as a sign he is still attractive.\\nAndy\\'s problem is solved when various office staff members agree to adopt the dogs. Darryl adopts a dog that helps Darryl exercise by taking him for walks. Kevin brags about his dog, Ruby, describing how she just lies around all day, never seems to eat and smells horrible. The office staff become horrified when they realize that the dog might be dead and Kevin doesn\\'t seem to realize it. However, a clip of Kevin and his dog show that the dog is in fact alive and is just extremely lazy.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/8_22_Fundraiser.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/6_7_The_Lover.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Dwight tries to get information on Jim by putting a wooden mallard in his office, which contains a listening device.\\nPam tells Erin to put the candy she brought on the reception desk, but Erin tells Pam that she is going to ask Michael for permission first. Michael then reveals to Jim that he is dating Helene, Pam\\'s mother. Jim is shocked and outraged that Michael is dating Helene and begs Michael not to tell Pam. However, Michael inadvertently reveals to Pam that he is, in fact, dating her mother. She runs to the parking lot screaming and calls her mom to tell her she is crazy for dating Michael.\\nMeanwhile, Jim discovers the listening device and makes Dwight nervous by playing classical music while pretending to be talking about Dwight to Andy. When Dwight asks what they were discussing Andy merely laughs that it would only make Dwight mad. \\nJim and Michael call a conference room meeting to ask for suggestions to improve community relations while Pam scoffs and belittles Michael after every word he says. Halfway through the meeting, Michael walks out to receive a call from Helene crying and then reenters the conference room to tell Pam to apologize to her mother, who then claims Michael owes her an apology instead to the bewilderment of the other office members. Michael then asks if he should apologize for finding comfort in a lover prompting Pam to shout at Michael to stop calling her mother his lover, filling in the rest of the branch on the situation. The Scranton branch berates Michael for doing so, until Michael invokes their sympathy by asking if he does not deserve to be happy. The Office members then tell Michael they won\\'t judge and wish Michael happiness to Pam\\'s outrage. Michael tells Pam to stop berating him and to leave the room which she refuses to. Michael tells Pam with a solemn look that she better be willing to die in this office like he is, only for her to defiantly says she is. \\nPam then has awkward encounters with Oscar when she says Michael could have sex with his mother, who she learns is in a wheelchair. Meanwhile, Angela cheerily asks Pam how her day is going and takes delight in her awkward encounter with Oscar. \\nIn the meantime Jim, gives the mallard to Kelly and Ryan and Dwight buys the mallard back from them.\\nMichael tries to be nice to Toby, so that he will try to calm Pam down, however Michael then calls him a jackass immediately after he is unable to. Michael then offers to Pam to stop dating her mother if she will forgive him which she accepts. Michael then refuses saying he thought Pam would have turned him down and asked him to be happy, prompting Pam to shout that she doesn\\'t care about his happiness at the moment. Michael then tells Pam that he\\'s going to \"start dating her even harder\" telling Pam she knows what he means. Afterwards Jim sees the mallard back on his desk and reveals to Dwight that he knows it is bugged. As punishment, Dwight agrees to wash and buff his car as punishment. \\nMichael leaves while Jim tries to calm Pam down by showing that Dwight is washing their car, telling her Dwight is doing so to cheer her up and they reminisce about their honeymoon, including a couple they met named Frank and Benny (\"Frank and Beans\") and an old couple who had kids also named Jim and Pam. Relenting, Pam wonders if she is indeed overreacting, but then insists that she is not, which Jim agrees with.\\nAfter everyone has left for the day, Dwight tells the documentary crew that he used the mallard as a diversion. His real listening device was a pen he dropped into Jim\\'s pen holder that recorded Jim\\'s entire workday. As he is listening to Jim\\'s customer calls, Dwight proudly tells the camera that he got eight hours of this.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/6_7_The_Lover.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/7_4_Sex_Ed.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Michael arrives at the office with a fake mustache to hide what he thinks is a pimple over his mouth.

Pam quickly attempts to quell the idea that the blemish may be cancerous, stating during a talking head interview that it\\'s best to stop a \"Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.\" During the discussion, Meredith also reveals to everyone that she has genital herpes, much to the discomfort of her co-workers.\\nAfter the office ridicules Meredith behind her back, Andy uses the opportunity to impress Erin by defending her. With some prodding from Dwight, Michael decides to tell his former lovers he has herpes, despite not yet having gone to a doctor. He calls Donna first, abruptly telling her to get tested. Michael then calls Holly, joking around with her before they have a more serious discussion about how Holly has been with her boyfriend A.J. for a year and a half. Michael voices his belief that he and Holly would have started a family had she stayed in Scranton; Holly disagrees, and much to Michael\\'s dismay, she reveals her belief that he over-romanticized their relationship. They end the call soon after and Dwight mentions that Michael forgot to inform her about his herpes. Michael and Dwight drive out to meet Michael\\'s former lovers in person. \\nAfter bribing the office with free pizza, Andy hosts a sex education class, which is actually a vague attempt to subtly find out if Gabe and Erin are having sex. Distraught after realizing that they are having sex, he uses a pencil to show how to apply a condom, to everyone\\'s laughter. Andy throws a tantrum and ends up smacking a box of pizza against the wall, hitting and staining a hanging picture, before storming out of the conference room.\\nMichael and Dwight meet up with Jan, who is growing to be a fairly successful office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals he has herpes. He states afterwards that he questions his own judgment, because he thought Jan was \"The One\" or \"at least one of The Ones\" and now he cannot believe he once thought that. He meets up with Helene, Pam\\'s mother, at a playground and after an awkward conversation where she also points out his skewed sense of memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets up with his former Realtor Carol while she is conducting an open house, who after attempting to be polite, also becomes abrupt and points out his faults too.\\nGabe takes Andy to his cubicle and admonishes him for his behavior, revealing he is aware of why Andy hosted the sex ed class. He also points out to Andy that the only reason he asked Erin out was because Andy gave his blessing, which Andy reveals was just a result of his difficulty saying no to how politely Gabe asked him. Gabe tells Andy that he needs to drop the matter. Afterward, Andy walks into Darryl\\'s office and cries, where an uncomfortable Darryl cheers him up by giving him vague supportive advice (which he reveals in a talking-head cutaway that he gives everyone).\\nMichael calls Holly only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him, and when seeing all his exes that day, he hadn\\'t been happy to see any of them. But when he talked to her, he was happy talking to her as much as she was happy to hear from him. He doesn\\'t understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers the time he spent with her perfectly and considers what they had as special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds \"Oh and you might - you should talk to a doctor, because you might have herpes. Bye!\"\\nThe final scene is a confrontation between Dwight, Michael, and Oscar. Michael and Dwight want all of the names of Oscar\\'s former lovers since Michael once kissed him, even though Dwight confirms that the \"cold sore\" was most likely an ingrown moustache hair. In disgust, Oscar walks out of Michael\\'s office as they begin listing stereotypes of places where homosexual intercourse occurs.\\nFrom an unknown source:\\nIn its original American broadcast on October 14, 2010, \"Sex Ed\" was viewed by an estimated 7.36 million viewers and received a 3.8 rating/10% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 increasing in viewers from the previous episode.

Michael tries to downplay the event with humor, questioning in particular why anyone would want to flash Phyllis. When that upsets the employees further, Michael sticks his finger outward through his fly and jokingly pretends that the flasher is back. After realizing that his jokes were horrible miscalculations, Michael overcompensates by verbally blasting the other men with self-righteous, fake-feminist indignance (to appear empathetic with the women).\\nNext, he forces everyone into an impromptu seminar on the everyday prejudices that women face -- after deeming himself the most qualified to teach it. Oblivious, as usual, to his own biases, Michael makes several sexist verbal gaffes. Panicked, he tries to make it up to the women by offering to take them to the place that they, as women, would feel the most comfortable: the mall. Although they consider the offer extremely condescending, they ultimately decide that they\\'d rather go shopping than stay at the office.\\nDwight takes charge of the effort to find the flasher, and orders Pam to make a sketch of \"the pervert\". However, Phyllis says that she didn\\'t get a good look his face, so Pam draws a picture of Dwight -- but, with a mustache and without glasses. An oblivious Dwight and a vengeful Andy dutifully set about posting fliers with the \"predator\\'s\" face. Later Andy says he would like to take some of the fliers and post them near where he lives (close to a school).\\nMichael\\'s group outing to the mall comes as he is beginning to openly doubt his relationship with Jan, having received an aggressive \"booty call\" from her earlier that day (which her assistant Hunter dutifully agreed to put on her schedule). Over lunch at the food court, Michael eventually starts \"dishing\" about his romance with Jan, after his attempt to prod them into gossiping yields awkward silence. (Angela abruptly leaves, mostly out of moral outrage, but also to special order clothes for her embarrassingly undersized frame.)\\nThe women encourage him to weigh the pros and cons of his relationship. During the exercise he slowly reveals, with noticeable unease and shame, that Jan is sexually controlling in ways that humiliate him. Karen tries to give Michael reasons to stay and work things out with Jan. Pam insists that his relationship with Jan is unhealthy; an open rivalry between Karen and Pam begins to brew. Finally, Michael flatly states that he\\'s not happy around Jan, and the women convince him that this particular \"con\" outweighs all of the \"pros.\"\\nPam is visibly pleased that her intuition won out over Karen\\'s. To thank them for their advice, Michael treats the women to one item each at Victoria\\'s Secret. Karen buys some sexy lingerie for her and Jim\\'s six-month anniversary (which a depressed Pam sees as she buys a fuzzy bathrobe, which she plans to cut up into towels).\\nMeanwhile, with the women out of the office, Kevin decides it is time to fulfill his fantasy of entering a women\\'s bathroom. He discovers a plush waiting room inside. Later, while Kevin, Jim, Ryan, and Toby hang out in the women\\'s room, Creed enters, and it is revealed that he uses the women\\'s room to \"go number two\" (but has been caught and has had to pay for it). Ryan sheepishly admits to Jim that he\\'d asked Karen out, via e-mail, in the past.\\nJim, visibly caught off-guard, recovers and replies that Karen had already read it to him, and that \"she liked him as a friend.\"\\nOn the way back from the mall, Meredith\\'s minivan breaks down, and Michael is unable to change the tire. Pam steps in and changes it herself. Upon returning to the office, Michael decides to call Jan and end their relationship. When he gets her voicemail, he leaves a message telling her he wants them to \"go on a little break, permanently.\" Before he can finish the message, Jan walks into his office, and Michael hangs up the phone, pretending he was speaking with a friend.\\nJan tells Michael that she feels badly about their earlier conversation, so she drove all the way from New York City to personally apologize. Michael, seeming touched but confused, accepts her apology. Her cell phone then buzzes, and Jan is initially pleased to see that she has a voicemail from Michael. Despite Michael\\'s protests, she listens to it immediately. When she hears the message she hangs up the phone; looking hurt, she leaves Michael\\'s office without a word.\\nThe episode ends with Jim giving Dwight a tip on the identity of the flasher. Jim tells him that he saw the pervert above the sink in the women\\'s bathroom. Dwight storms into the bathroom, where a mustache has been drawn on one of the mirrors. Upon seeing his reflection line up with the mustache, Dwight realizes he was duped by Pam.\\nAn alternate version of the episode aired on August 30, 2007:\\nAfter the episode aired, callers to the telephone number printed on the flyer received a message from Dwight Schrute:\\nThe same phone number would later be used in the episode \"Chair Model\" for W.B.

When Michael returns to the Dunder Mifflin office to entice them to join him, everyone declines the offer. While Michael \"relieves stress\" in the room formerly the Michael Scott Paper Company, Erin tries to deliver him a memo. Michael forbids work and Erin begins to dance with him. They later return to the office, both with espresso cups, and Michael announces he has figured out what\\'s going on. He believes Charles made them become \"too focused on work\". In an attempt to get the office more relaxed, he explains about the converted room downstairs. Erin finally helps Michael put a label to the room: the Café Disco. Kevin joins Michael downstairs for the all-you-can-drink espresso, but Angela needs him to return to work. Michael sympathizes with the founders of Phillip Morris inasmuch as his attempt to give people a means of relaxation is rejected.\\nMichael\\'s next attempt to increase attendance to the Café Disco is to hold the boom box speaker up to the ceiling vent, piping \"Everybody Dance Now\" into the Dunder Mifflin office. Phyllis, won over by the music, leaves to get Bob. When she enters Vance Refrigeration, Bob\\'s new secretary, Jessica (who bears physical resemblance to Phyllis), informs Phyllis her husband doesn\\'t want to be disturbed. Suspicious, Phyllis leaves a message with Jessica and proceeds to the Café Disco. Michael is surprised Phyllis would show up, but quickly overcomes this and they begin dancing. While dancing, Phyllis throws out her back. Michael texts Dwight for assistance and the two wheel her back up to the office. Dwight takes Phyllis into the conference room and tends to her as he would a horse. He cuts open the back of her shirt to massage her, hand-feeds her vegetables, and says \"whoa, girl,\" when she tries to get up. Phyllis confesses to him her fear that Bob may cheat on her with his secretary but the two laugh when she realizes how ridiculous the idea sounds.\\nThough Michael tries to still promote interest in the Café Disco everyone wishes Michael would stop his shenanigans. Michael throws his keys at Erin, tells her to \"shut it down\", and storms into his office to eat his lunch alone. Kelly helps Erin dismantle the Café Disco but when Kelly turns off the light, Erin decides to turn on the boom box. They begin dancing, and Leo from the warehouse notices them. In no time, the room is packed with nearly everyone from the office and even Erin\\'s friend Ashley. Upstairs, Michael hears the music from the revived Café Disco and follows it. Andy begins a dance off with Kelly. Creed donates the mini disco ball he\\'d been using as a rearview mirror. Angela walks straight under the limbo pole and tries to get Michael to sign some papers. Michael refuses to sign more than one paper per song, exasperating Angela. Michael further forbids her to clean up to which Angela exclaims \"am I not allowed to have some fun?\"\\nJim and Pam decide they are going to get married today in Youngstown, Ohio, because there is no three-day waiting period. Jim picks some flowers from the planters outside the office and presents them to Pam. As they leave to elope, they stop by the Café Disco. Nobody seems to notice Pam\\'s pink wedding dress as she and Jim join the party. Dwight and Phyllis return (her blouse mended with staples) and they begin to dance as well, Phyllis with Bob. While everyone dances to the song \"YMCA\", Kevin makes out with Lynn and Jim and Pam realize they both want a real wedding. In the end, although she refuses to dance, Angela taps her foot to the beat.

Nellie and Oscar read the review aloud for everyone to hear. As soon as Stanley is done clambering up the steps, Dwight tells him that they are going on a sales call. Nellie eavesdrops on Pam, who is talking to her mother. Pam explains that she will be watching her children tonight for her and Jim. Outside, they talk and it is revealed they are going to a marriage counseling class for their obvious straining relationship. Toby and Jim talk about marriage counseling as well and Jim explains that he and Pam are having problems. She doesn\\'t like that Jim does certain things without her input and that she has to, in a sense, catch up.

Erin turns her computer monitor around to face the office and Angela is seen on screen with Senator Lipton, who announces that he is gay. Lipton recognizes Oscar as the one who helped him accept that he was gay. Lipton also recognizes and states his love for his Chief of Staff, Wesley Silver, who he has also been seeing, to Oscar\\'s shock. Clark and Dwight have to struggle getting Stanley into the car. At a local talent agent\\'s office, Andy meets a man who has a Saint Bernard, a cat on top of the dog, and a mouse on top of the cat. The man says there \"isn\\'t a point\" in naming the mice because he goes through so many. At the client meeting, a drowsy Stanley spurts out random phrases, particularly about the children in the pictures on the desk. Back at Toby\\'s office, Jim expresses that if Pam doesn\\'t want to move the family to Philly, they will need a lot more than just counseling. Pam confirms to Nellie that she refuses to move to Philadelphia. Later, Nellie and Toby agree with each other that Jim and Pam are both very yappy.

Dwight, on the other hand, is vehement that something influenced the numbers and suspects Kelly of tampering with the reports, perhaps with co-conspirators. Dwight talks about it to Jim, who doesn't believe him until he notices Kelly being uncharacteristically succinct with him when they talk. When asking Ryan about Kelly's recent behavior, Jim notices that Ryan has a coffee mug with his face on it, something he had noticed Andy also had earlier. Ryan explains that the mugs were party favors at an America's Got Talent party Kelly hosted over the summer. Jim discovers that everyone in the office has one, except for him and Dwight, as they didn't attend the party, and he deduces that Kelly tampered with their reports out of spite.

He pulls her into the conference room and tells her he thinks that she shouldn't move back to Scranton. Jim, still listening on the Bluetooth, remarks that it's pretty clear Alex has a crush on her. Alex goes on to tell her that if she really wants to pursue a career in art, then only three months in New York isn't going to do any good for her.

Angela agrees on the condition that the location is on a hand-plowed farm with an old barn, within special requirements, and within a 5-8 mile radius. Andy looks up possible locations and chooses Schrute Farms as the location since he is acquainted with Dwight and believes he can get a good deal.

Kelly urges Pam not to sleep with Alan on the first date. Pam admits in an interview that she is nervous and has not been on a first date in nine years. Overhearing date chat, Michael suggests Pam wear her wedding dress as a joke, and Dwight chimes in that her veil should complete the ensemble.

Michael also converses briefly with Stamford regional manager Josh, who informs Michael that should his branch absorb the Scranton branch, he will find a position within his new Stamford branch for Michael. Concern washes across Michael\\'s face when he hears this. Michael also queries Jan about \"the 800-pound gorilla in the room,\" Carol. Saying that Jan must keep her hands off of him during the convention, Jan tells Michael to move away from her, and Michael thanks her for her cooperation. Angela secretly arrives at the convention incognito under the name \"Jane Doe\".\\nMichael and Dwight meet Jerome Bettis, who is signing autographs at the convention, and appear to mistake him for Mr. T. Bettis is reluctant to commit to Michael\\'s party in Room 308. Michael informs Dwight that Bettis is nicknamed \"The Bus\" because of the pro footballer\\'s fear of flight. During lunch, Michael updates Jim on the Scranton happenings including Ryan taking over Jim\\'s position and desk. Jim sends his regards and Michael promises to phone him that afternoon with the sentiment. Jim begins to ask how a former co-worker is doing but briefly hesitates before the name, eventually naming Toby. Michael responds by asking if Toby was why Jim left, or if he had considered bosses, leading to an inquiry as to what Jim thought of Josh compared to Michael. Jim states that it\\'s not a competition.\\nMichael assigns Dwight to dig up any dirt on Josh. Michael takes a work-related phone call from Pam, and Jim is surprised when Michael wishes her luck on her date. Dwight informs Michael his contact at the sheriff\\'s office isn\\'t volunteering this day.\\nMichael promotes a Scranton v. Stamford paper airplane game at the Hammermill booth, but his plane crashes upon takeoff. Jim and Josh head off to other business and Michael brings the Hammermill salesperson to his room where he shares his emotions over Jim leaving his branch and discusses paper with the rep. As a result, Michael surprises the entire Dunder Mifflin contingent with the news he broke Staples\\' exclusive hold on Hammermill products and secured a deal with the company, impressing Jan. Michael even proceeds to tip the hotel waiter with his company per diem of $100 as just another way to try and impress Jan (which belittles her).\\nJim has Dwight\\'s room key and walks in on Angela (whom he mistakes for a prostitute) and he immediately leaves the room. He is shocked by the experience and tries to think of someone to call to share the news.\\nBack in the Scranton office, Kevin expresses to Toby his lust for Pam now that she has started dating again. Toby responds by pondering and eventually aborting asking her out. Phyllis suggests Pam order an expensive entree at dinner to show she\\'s worth it. Stanley concludes an expensive dinner requires Pam to \"put out.\" which Phyllis agrees would happen.\\nOn the double date, Kelly looks to be the only one having a good time, chatting and shoving food into a fairly embarrassed Ryan\\'s mouth. Pam is nervous and talks to her dull date who states that he gets his comic strip ideas from the world around him, or in a dream. On a napkin, he sketches a scene referencing the 2003 freedom fries controversy and states that it works on many levels. He reveals people tell him not to be edgy in his cartoons, but it is the only way he knows. When Pam politely laughs, Alan appears to briefly look down her shirt, causing Pam to subtly button it higher.\\nJim arrives on the third floor to pulsating vocoder-based electronic music and finds Michael sitting and playing with convention swag by a strobe light. He says people have been filtering in and out of the party. Jim asks for a drink, and as Michael serves him a Cosmo, says he realizes that their boss-employee friendship was brief but not something Jim wanted to keep. Jim tells him he did not leave because he is a bad boss and calls Michael a great boss, and he left after he laid himself on the line to Pam and she rejected him, twice.\\nNow understanding of the situation, Michael says he will talk to Pam, which Jim insists he does not do. Michael also suggests that Jim talk to Roy\\xa0because Roy knows exactly how he is feeling. Jim says he might. He and Michael makeup and their renewed friendship is announced to party guests from the Hammermill staff.\\nPam\\'s date ends with Alan picking his teeth and telling her to bring her sketches next time. She informs the camera that she has not found a love connection.\\nA final tidbit finds Michael and Dwight preparing the black light for the Room 308 party. The light reveals stains covering the walls, comforter and headboard. Dwight speculates the stains are blood, urine, or semen, and a disgusted Michael says he hopes they are urine.\\nThe Season Three DVD contains a number of deleted scenes.\\nAfter the episode aired, NBC made some deleted scenes available online, including the following scenes not included on the DVD:\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/3_2_The_Convention.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/8_4_Garden_Party.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Andy decides to throw a garden party at Schrute Farms to impress both Robert and his parents. Andy is noticeably jealous at the amount of attention his younger brother Walter Bernard, Jr. receives from his father, and he thinks that by throwing an elaborate party he can ensure his father\\'s blessings. At first, the party goes along smoothly. Andy decides to make a toast to his fellow employees in hopes that they will toast him in return, as if to show his parents and California that he is a respected individual among his employees. His plan backfires, however, and instead many people end up praising Robert. To get everybody\\'s mind off of Robert, Andy decides to sing \"More Than Words\" as a duet with his father. This too goes awry as his visibly-annoyed father corrects his playing and singing, and ultimately decides to sing a duet with Walter Jr. instead of Andy. Visibly upset, Andy stops their singing and storms off.\\nSoon thereafter, Andy is confronted by his father for his \"obnoxious attitude\", which he turns into a browbeating on Andy as \"manager of some rinky dink branch\". This conversation is overheard by the other staff on the baby monitor Jim and Pam brought for their daughter, and Pam quickly turns off the monitor to let Andy save face. Darryl and Oscar later confide to the camera that they now understand why Andy feels he needs to prove himself to everyone. After his family leaves, a dejected Andy, feeling unwanted by his family and co-workers, says goodbye to the office staff as they turn the garden party into a barbecue. Darryl and Oscar, however, manage to convince Andy to stay with a cheeseburger and a beer, and they all satisfyingly watch as Dwight performs the closing ceremonies to the garden party.\\nMeanwhile, Dwight works to make the garden party a classy event. Dwight thoroughly reads a book called The Ultimate Guide to Throwing a Garden Party that he\\'d bought online, thinking it was a great buy. However, the book is revealed to be an elaborate prank, secretly written by Jim under the pseudonym \"James Trickington\". The book gives outlandish advice such as announcing each guest\\'s name as they arrive in an extremely loud manner among other absurd \"duties\" (imitating The Last Supper in the middle of a meal, randomly dancing with his party staff, etc.). Near the end of the episode, Andy and the staff look on in delight as Dwight and his workers perform a fire court dance (as part of the Trickington book) as a closing ceremonies. The episode then ends with footage of Jim abusing Dwight\\'s announcing duties by walking past him and then walking back again, prompting Dwight to shout his name each time he does so.\\nAlso, Pam feuds with co-worker Angela over baby names. Pam and Angela learn they\\'ve both chosen the name Phillip for their soon-to-be-born sons, with Pam choosing to name her child after her deceased grandfather and Angela after the name of her favorite cat. Angela, visibly annoyed that Pam doesn\\'t relinquish the name right away, later makes a toast to \"my son Phillip\" at the garden party—only to have Pam make the same toast but describe in great detail how the name honors her now-dead grandfather. Angela, unwilling to reveal her feline-centric reasons for the name, grouses to the camera that Pam is always copying her.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/8_4_Garden_Party.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/6_17_and_18_The_Delivery.md'}\ndoc: page_content='When Pam and Jim call their clients to ask them if they need anything before they have their baby, Dwight thinks that they are abusing their situation to ring up sales.

Dwight gets on Jim's nerves so he and Pam decide to post Dwight's resume on the web. Angela gets mad at Pam for bringing brownies instead of chips and dip to the office party. Dwight's resume gets a hit from a company in Maryland, so Jim plays Michael and gives Dwight a great reference. When the company, Cumberland Mills, calls Dwight to set up an interview, Dwight immediately ruins his chances by having a rather stern argument with the caller over the importance and relevance of martial arts.Dwight's first Halloween costume Pam thinks Jim should be the one to be getting better job offers and mentions to Jim that, given the salary and growth potential there, he should apply for the Cumberland Mills job. Jim is clearly hurt by the suggestion, thinking that perhaps Pam wouldn't care if he left. Pam tries to back-pedal but Jim makes clear his feelings. Michael tries to practice his firing skills with Jim, but doesn't fire him.After Jim leaves his office, Pam comes over and grabs his hand and says it was crazy. Jim walks away which leaves Pam upset.

Michael and Jim constantly find themselves at odds with each other as Michael keeps having \"conference room meetings\" while Jim wants to keep productivity in the office place. They get a call from CFO David Wallace who tells them that the budget for cost-of-living raises is limited, and the managers must decide how to distribute it. Michael suggests giving a small 1.5% raise to everyone and gets annoyed when Jim suggests making a list of pros and cons. Jim decides to give the raises to the sales staff since they bring money to the company. Michael is against the idea, but invites Jim to announce it to the office.\\nJim tells the office that they are only going to give raises to the sales staff, which clearly upsets the non-sales staff. Dwight, not wanting Jim as a boss, complains about the unfairness of Jim\\'s decision despite being a salesperson. Michael, who was scoffing at Jim, is then asked to give his idea, but he does not speak coherently about it, leading everyone to say that Jim was at least being direct despite having a bad idea. Michael and Jim go back into the conference room to decide how to handle the raise issue. They ultimately decide that the raises should be performance-based, and decide to take turns placing beans on employee pictures to determine how much of a raise each person deserves. Jim believes that it is a good idea, but when Michael and Jim leave the conference room, Dwight goes into the conference room and shows the employees their plan. Everyone gets upset at Michael and Jim for this, particularly Pam, whose picture did not have any beans, as Jim was trying to remain unbiased.\\nWith the entire office now upset with both Michael and Jim, Dwight uses this opportunity to start an uprising against Jim personally. However, everyone in the office refuses to as they are more concerned about the raise issue. Michael then goes into Jim\\'s office to check on him. Michael explains he felt terrible having to make those kinds of decisions on his own and he leaves to get Jim something.

Michael determined that Angela and Phyllis became too power hungry when they were the sole heads at their respective times, and it would be best for both of them to step down and appoint two new heads.

Several bloggers notice Jim not using his Sabre Arrowhead phone, resulting in a reprimand from Nellie. Erin disappears with a group of seniors after Dwight drives them away, fearing their age will frighten the youth.

Jim is forced to give the presentation, which, despite a rocky start, impresses the crowd. After the opening, Dwight is named VP by Nellie.\\nBack in Scranton, Andy tries to protect Pam from a group of kids who are throwing pine cones at her, and a young girl, Tiffany, punches him in the eye. Andy tells a false story about stepping in when a \"gang\" harassed Pam, and Toby arranges a meeting in the conference room to discuss self-defense. Andy is then humiliated when Tiffany is brought in by her mother and half-apologizes to him and Pam. However, after a provoked Kelly begins physically harassing Toby, Andy steps in between the two to break the fight up, resulting in his other eye being blackened. The rest of the office laughs but shuts up when Andy points out he got hit twice because he defended other people who were being attacked. The episode concludes with Andy noting that he took a bunch of pain medication, drank a half a bottle of wine, and took his pants off, thus greatly improving his feelings as the day ends.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/8_17_Test_the_Store.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/1_6_Hot_Girl.md'}\ndoc: page_content='A purse vendor, Katy, comes in to the office to sell purses for the day.

They are also upset that Michael treats Pam and Ryan with more respect because they were the only people to follow him to his new company, with Michael believing his company operates within the branch despite the buyout. Dwight calls a secret meeting in the warehouse with the salespeople, minus Pam and Ryan, to think of a way to get their clients back.\\nJim, trying to remain impartial, informs Michael of the potential mutiny and heads to the break room to play chess with Creed until the conflict is resolved.

Michael carefully times the conversation so that he reveals the affair while simultaneously driving out of the parking lot. A shocked and dismayed Andy heads back into the office to confront Angela regarding the affair, but she continues to hold back, as everyone else looks on. Andy then confronts Dwight about it and challenges him to a duel in the parking lot over who gets Angela, which Dwight accepts. Angela finds this flattering.

Catching a look from Pam, Karen suddenly asks if she\\'s still interested in Jim, to which Pam absently replies \"oh yeah.\" Karen is taken aback, but Pam then quickly says she misunderstood Karen\\'s question, and awkwardly tells Karen \"You should go out with Jim—you are going out with Jim. You\\'re a great couple.\"\\nThe female stripper arrives, dressed as an office secretary. Roy claims in a talking-head that\\'s he\\'s \"not really into strippers,\" and that he instead finds Pam\\'s art sexy. When groom-to-be Bob Vance refuses a lap-dance, Michael volunteers. The dance proceeds for a few seconds before Michael suddenly remembers he has a girlfriend and abruptly calls a halt and breaks up the party.\\nDwight makes the now-fully-clothed stripper, Elizabeth, answer phone calls in the office, because he has already paid her for three hours of work. She compliments a clearly distressed Angela about the baby poster she received in \"Christmas Party\".\\nMichael goes to the stripper for advice as to whether he should tell Jan about his lap-dance. She replies, \"secret secrets are no fun, secret secrets hurt someone.\" Dwight claims that he is ninety-nine percent sure that the impersonator is not the real Ben Franklin, \"no matter what Jim says!\"\\nThe Ben Franklin impersonator reveals to Pam that his real name is Gordon in an unsuccessful attempt to hit on her. He also tells Michael to keep the lap dance a secret. Michael calls him a sleazebag. He then calls Jan out of a meeting to confess to her the aborted lap dance. A frustrated Jan tells him she\\'s closer to firing him than dumping him. Michael seems to take this as good news.\\nPam and Jim have an understated confrontation in the break room which ends with Pam asking Ryan to set her up with some of his business-school buddies, in front of a visibly shocked Jim. Dwight grills Ben Franklin on his revolutionary-era knowledge, and Michael reflects that Ben Franklin turned out to be a creep while the stripper turned out to give great advice... advice that rhymed.\\nThe Season Three DVD contains a number of deleted scenes.

Michael brings Dwight along to help gather information. Michael goes to the owner as a potential customer under his alias \"Michael Scarn\" while Dwight goes in as himself requesting a job. Michael succeeds in getting the customer list from the already struggling family business, run by a Vietnam War veteran. They use the client list as a reference for future sales and he and Dwight leave victorious. However, Michael breaks the bumper off his car trying to get out of the parking space, which catches the attention of the Prince family. They come out to help fix the bumper as much as they can as Michael watches. Michael is visibly moved by their kindness and has a change of heart regarding giving the customer list to Wallace, while Dwight remains unmoved.\\nBack at the office, Dwight tries to convince Michael that he can\\'t let his heart get in the way of business. Michael obliges to send the list to Wallace, but not before he tries to escape back to Prince Paper to give them back the list. Dwight manages to chase Michael down and take the list from him, causing him to finally give in. David Wallace calls Michael to congratulate him on getting him the list. Michael then explains he feels \"bittersweet\" about the ordeal, bitter because he potentially ruined a decent family, and sweet because he satisfied Wallace, and afterward claiming that as the reason for not liking bittersweet chocolate.\\nMeanwhile, the rest of the office start arguing over whether or not Hilary Swank is hot. Half of the office say she is while the other half say she isn\\'t. The argument gets heated at various points. Jim temporarily convinces Kevin to say she is by having him imagine Hilary kissing him, only to have him switch back when he says the debate is whether or not she is hot, not if he would have sex with her. Angela, initially reluctant to join the debate, takes the \"hot\" side stating Kevin deserves to lose for saying that he thought it would be revealed in Boys Don\\'t Cry that Hilary was actually a male.\\nKelly gets emotional when Toby says she isn\\'t, making Kelly feel like she herself is not hot. Pam claims they shouldn\\'t let the Kevins of the world decide who is hot or not, mentioning that they don\\'t give Kevin full internet access. Oscar is seen in the board room giving an overhead presentation about the structure of Hilary Swank\\'s facial features, ending by saying, \"not hot\". Stanley gives an uncharacteristically inspiring speech on how hot she is. At the end of the debate the sides are still tied, with Oscar noting there isn\\'t much of a point to debating as people would still stay on their sides. At the end of the episode, Michael, oblivious of their debate, looks at photos of Hilary on the wall, saying she\\'s hot, casting the deciding vote.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/5_13_Prince_Family_Paper.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/6_13_Secret_Santa.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Michael is outraged when Jim promises Phyllis she can be Santa.

Michael poutingly puts his Santa hat in the punch and storms into his office. He takes off his Santa suit and puts it back on inside out, emerging as Jesus. Angela is seen looking very happy when seeing Michael as Jesus. While Phyllis is giving the office employees their Secret Santa presents, Michael belittles many of them, including Stanley for cheating on his wife (as was revealed in Gossip). However, Michael tries to redeem himself, and smiles when Dwight gets his present. Angela is extremely offended after Michael says Jesus \"ruined the party\".\\nMeanwhile, Jim and Dwight (who is taking a break from his diabolical plan, revealed in Scott\\'s Tots) try to get the office into the Christmas spirit, despite the uncertainty in Dunder Mifflin\\'s future. Dwight thinks he may be depressed. They unveil the office Christmas tree, but the rest of the employees (including Pam) are displeased to see it\\'s artificial and undecorated. Jim says he was hoping they could all decorate it together.\\nDwight gets a gift in pieces that he must assemble from his Secret Santa. He is desperate to know what it is and creates a list of the things he believes it could be. Michael continues throughout the episode to deliver pieces. At first Dwight thinks it is a gun, but it is really a nutcracker. Jim ultimately plans a successful party, which Pam loves. The warehouse even comes to the party, including Madge and Calvin, who have not been seen in a while.\\nOscar has a secret crush on Matt, a new warehouse worker. Pam notices Oscar watching Matt play football. Oscar holds off giving Matt his pay check so he can deliver it in person, but Matt isn\\'t there. Darryl hints that he suspects something between them, and Oscar leaves. Pam continues to secretly watch Oscar throughout. Pam is openly supportive in two talking heads telling the crew, \"they are the only two gay guys I know\". Pam sets them up, but Oscar purposefully mistakes Matt\\'s name as \"Mark\". Pam looks at Oscar inquisitively, but Oscar assures her he knows what he\\'s doing.\\nMichael calls David Wallace, who tells him Dunder Mifflin is being bought out. When Michael tells everyone they are losing their jobs, they all conference-call David from Michael\\'s office. David clarifies that everyone from corporate will lose their jobs, but that the Scranton branch is safe. Jim sympathizes with David while Meredith randomly tells him his wife is a very lucky woman. The whole office is thrilled and Michael jumps into the crowd. They decide to continue the Christmas party.\\nAll the while Andy has been giving Erin The 12 Days of Christmas, including the many animals, for Secret Santa. According to Erin, her cat killed a turtle dove and the French hens have started pulling out her hair to make a nest. She comes in the office with a deep scar. Erin tries to figure out who her Secret Santa is since her gift is causing her injury and begs them to stop. Andy awkwardly denies giving Erin the present and begs Phyllis not to tell Erin. Phyllis willingly agrees. However, during Michael\\'s snarky Jesus routine, he reveals that Andy was, in fact, Erin\\'s Secret Santa. Erin asks Andy what he was thinking, but seems thrilled when Andy gets twelve drummers drumming to play for her in the last scene.\\nNBC made a Producer\\'s Cut of the episode online, which includes the following new material:\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/6_13_Secret_Santa.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/3_13_Traveling_Salesmen.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Kevin informs Angela that the corporate office has yet to receive important tax documents and warns Angela that if she forgot to send them in, \"it is a big deal.\" Angela states that Corporate received the documents that morning, but appears troubled. Dwight arrives at the office, where Angela has intently perched herself near reception. Angela asks if everything is okay, and Dwight informs her that she \"is in the clear.\" Angela is visibly relieved.\\nDwight, fresh from the road, arrives late to Michael\\'s \"dream team\" sales meeting, prompting taunts from Andy Bernard regarding his tardiness. Michael informs them that at Andy\\'s suggestion, they\\'ll be pairing up for sales-call duty. Given first choice, Andy selects Michael, flattering him. Phyllis, whom Michael refers to as \"our resident senior\" picks Karen. Told he cannot select \"pass\", Stanley selects Ryan. Dwight is angered when he is left to partner with Jim. Dwight seeks coworkers willing to trade, but as Jim is the sole volunteer, the four pairs head out to the parking lot.\\nMichael tosses a bag of laundry to Dwight who in turn throws it into his Trans Am. Michael dubs the sales calls The Amazing Race, prompting some confusion as he explains that there will be no winner, and that a prize will not be awarded for the largest sale. To supplement his statement, he assigns each pair a nickname based on previous contenders from Race. Michael dubs Stanley and Ryan \"the retired Marines\", Phyllis and Karen \"mother and daughter\", Jim and Dwight \"the gay couple\", and his own team \"the firefighter heroes\". Before heading out, Michael snatches Phyllis\\'s car keys from her hand and tosses them underneath her vehicle. Upon the team\\'s departure, Angela invites Pam for coffee.\\nFacilitated by a series of unique stationary in-car shots, the sales calls unfold.\\nAndy, riding shotgun in Michael\\'s convertible, continually badmouths Dwight, using suggestive language in an attempt to sway Michael\\'s opinion of the man. He becomes frustrated, however, as Michael casually deflects his suggestions. Andy questions Michael as to why Dwight does his laundry. Michael explains that Dwight\\'s laundry duty is punishment for attempting to take Michael\\'s job in a secret meeting with Jan.\\nAt the sales call, Michael\\'s attempt to sell the small-town personal feel of Dunder Mifflin is thwarted as Andy interrupts with tales of his privileged upbringing and boasting of the company\\'s listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Afterward Andy apologizes for losing the sale, informing Michael that he really \"screwed that up... I really Schruted it\".\\nEn route, Ryan asks Stanley if he can take the lead on the sales call, and Stanley happily accepts. The pair meet with four African American men in the lobby of their business, one of whom knows Stanley; and, actually, Stanley then tells Ryan to make the pitch, while he does some crosswords. Flustered, Ryan is unable to mutter anything but \"Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.\" Later Stanley mocks Ryan for his ineptitude, comparing his behavior to that of his six-month-old niece.\\nBefore they depart, Jim reveals to the camera that he and Dwight used to frequently go on sales calls in the past, and produces an old picture of the young sales duo. Dwight sits in the rear driver\\'s-side seat of Jim\\'s Subaru. Before entering the building, Dwight requests that Jim leave the keys to the car, to which Jim replies, \"You still do that thing?\" Dwight then proceeds to listen to a heavy metal solo (Kickstart My Heart by Mötley Crüe) while punching the driver seat\\'s headrest and playing an \"air guitar\". At the sales call, the pair enact a tag-team sales routine, wherein Dwight borrows a phone and works his way through the call center of what he says is a competing paper company and is put on hold for several minutes while Jim dials Dunder Mifflin customer service and Kelly answers immediately and amicably. A sale is quickly made.\\nRather than immediately head out on their call, Phyllis drives Karen to a nearby beauty salon and purchases an outlandish beauty treatment she describes as \"makeovers\" for the pair, which results in their taking on hairstyles of a horrible, earlier era. At their sales call, a large sale is quickly procured. Karen is impressed with Phyllis\\' savvy as it is revealed through a photograph on the client\\'s desk that his wife subscribes to a similar beauty sensibility. Later, Phyllis mentions her happiness for Karen and Jim\\'s relationship as she had worried he would never overcome his crush on Pam, inadvertently revealing its existence to Karen.\\nAt a coffee shop, Pam notices Angela\\'s happy glow and inquires. Angela tells Pam a thinly-veiled story of her friend \"Noelle\", who missed a deadline to send in important documents to corporate in New York and the \"gallant gentleman\", \"Kurt\" who drove the documents all the way to New York and handed them in for her. Pam glances knowingly at the camera. (Angela, never very imaginative, uses her and Dwight\\'s middle names to disguise their identity.)\\nUpon their return, Karen invites Jim to coffee where he assures her that his crush on Pam has passed and that he is glad that Karen moved to Scranton. Meanwhile, Andy steals Dwight\\'s car keys and searches his car, yielding a tollbooth receipt from a trip that morning to New York. Proffering the stolen ticket as evidence, Andy\\'s suggestions finally begin to take hold as Michael is coaxed into believing that Dwight has gone behind his back to the corporate office, betraying him again. After confirming with Jan that Dwight was present at corporate that morning, Michael approaches him with Andy in tow, demanding an explanation. Dwight refuses to acknowledge or explain his presence at the corporate office, but assures Michael that he has not betrayed him. Michael insists on an explanation by the end of the day, implying that Dwight may be fired if he does not comply with his request.\\nDwight and Angela consult. It is made clear that Dwight will have to choose between betraying Angela by making their relationship public or betraying Michael by withholding information about his whereabouts that morning. Shortly after, Dwight stands up at his desk, requests the attention of the office and announces his resignation:\\nHe bequeaths his box of desk items to Michael, but pulls away two bobblehead dolls, including the likeness of himself. On his way out, Dwight approaches and embraces Jim who is walking with Karen through the parking lot, confusing the two; both were talking over coffee when Dwight\\'s resignation occurred. Andy gloats to the camera about his clever plan to get rid of Dwight while Angela vengefully glares at Andy from the background, suspicious that he\\'s responsible for Dwight\\'s resignation.\\nWhen the episode re-aired on March 15, 2007, it was re-cut to introduce a new story line (which NBC called a \"Newpeat\"):\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/3_13_Traveling_Salesmen.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/1_1_Pilot.md'}\ndoc: page_content='A documentary crew gives a firsthand introduction to the staff of the Scranton branch of the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, managed by Michael Scott.\\nDuring a meeting, Jim Halpert tells his boss, Michael, that he couldn\\'t close a sale with the library.

He thinks she might have been a smoker.\\nMichael shows his mugMichael tells the camera that he\\'s worked for Dunder-Mifflin for 12 years and has been Regional Manager for 4. The branch has the entire second floor of the building. He introduces the camera to receptionist Pam Beesly and mentions how much better she looked a couple of years ago. She gives him a fax from corporate which he crumples up and tosses into the trash, calling it his special file for messages from the corporate office. He shows the camera his World\\'s Best Boss mug and tells how he bought it from Spencer Gifts.\\nJim tries to explain his job selling paper, but admits it\\'s boring him even talking about it.\\nMichael comes out of his office and shouts the years-old gag \"Whassssuuupp?\" to Jim and Dwight who play along.\\nMichael\\'s direct supervisor, Jan Levinson-Gould, then enters the office for a meeting with Michael. Michael admits he calls her Hillary Rodham Clinton, but not because he\\'s afraid of her. Jan asks if Michael has any questions about the agenda which he claims not to have seen and proceeds to lecture Pam who then reveals, in front of Jan, that Michael threw it away. Michael backpedals that it was just a joke.\\nJan explains that corporate doesn\\'t see the point in having both the Scranton and Stamford branches. Michael immediately assumes the worst. Jan tries to assure him that it\\'s not a foregone conclusion that Scranton will be shut down. Michael wonders if Josh, the regional manager at Stamford, is worried about downsizing.\\nThen Michael takes a call from Todd Packer, the branch\\'s traveling salesman, who, not realizing he\\'s on speakerphone in Jan\\'s presence, calls her \"Godzillary\" and asks Michael if the carpet matches the drapes. Michael quickly realizes his mistake and mumbles about how inappropriate that was.\\nJan concludes the meeting by asking Michael to keep all of this information under wraps for now.\\nIn the break room, Oscar Martinez, Phyllis Vance, and Stanley Hudson are at a table talking about the possibility of downsizing. Oscar admits he\\'s updating his resume. Angela Martin worries she\\'ll be let go and Kevin Malone agrees. Jim and Pam are too busy laughing about whether or not they will attend Angela\\'s cat party on Sunday.\\nIn the midst of all this, Ryan Howard arrives from the temporary employment agency. Michael demonstrates his humor by imitating Moe, from The Three Stooges and Adolf Hitler. It\\'s clear that Michael\\'s idea of humor is lost on his employees.\\nPam admits it wouldn\\'t be the worst thing if she was laid off. She enjoys working with watercolor and oil pencils. Jim likes her work.\\nWall of pencils between Jim and DwightWhile Jim is trying to make a sales call, Dwight distracts him by using his ruler to push some of Jim\\'s overlapping papers off of his desk. In retaliation, Jim built a pencil fence between his desk and Dwight\\'s, which Dwight smashes with his phone. Because of this, Jim tells the camera he\\'s not afraid of the downsizing issue. Dwight, too, tells the camera he has no problem with downsizing and that he has been recommending it since he first arrived at Dunder Mifflin.\\nPam hands Michael some of his messages. He pretends to act like the Six Million Dollar Man for several long moments. He decides that six million dollars would be a great salary for him and asks Pam\\'s opinion. Pam mentions her salary could use a boost, too. Suddenly, Michael becomes serious, lecturing Pam she should take up her salary concerns with HR if she thinks there\\'s a problem.\\nThe staff is called into the conference room. Dwight, desperate to help, wants to back up Michael as Assistant Regional Manager. Michael will only acquiesce to Assistant to the Regional Manager. Michael explains that he\\'s aware of the rumors and can confirm that Jan has indicated to him that there might be downsizing which could involve either Scranton or Stamford. Both Oscar and Stanley question Michael\\'s assurances that he will not permit this branch to be closed. To change the subject, he tries to field a question from Pam who he claims looks like she wants to ask a question. Pam mentions that, being present in the meeting with Jan, it certainly did sound like Scranton could be shuttered.

He and Ryan distract Michael by making dessert puns. Michael can\\'t think of one.\\nJim tries to convince Pam to join the gang for some drinks after work. Her fiancé, Roy, one of the warehouse workers, arrives. Pam admits that she and Roy have been engaged for three years. They are supposed to be married in September, but she believes it\\'ll probably not be until Spring. Roy tells her he just wants to go home. She leaves her desk to finish up some work. Jim tries to make small talk, but Roy isn\\'t having it.\\nJim tells the camera that he doesn\\'t think he\\'ll be invited to the wedding.\\nWhile Michael conveys his management style to Ryan (friend first, boss second), he decides to pull a prank on Pam.

Michael chuckles about the normally-choleric Stanley doing any dancing when he reveals his tidbit to the salespeople. Phyllis dismisses him because she knows that Stanley\\'s wife, Teri, is out of town. Furthermore, they all know Stanley isn\\'t the type to like crowded public places.\\nAfter confronting the interns, who are adamant that they saw Stanley dancing with someone, Michael realizes that he may have uncovered a bigger secret. Now, he replaces his dancing story by telling everyone that Stanley is having an affair.

He became involved with his physical therapist, Cynthia, after his heart attack. He was just going to meet her to call the whole thing off and implores Michael not to tell anyone. Having already told the entire office, Michael decides to fix the problem by spreading all kinds of made-up rumors about the rest of the staff to cover himself. One of them turns out to be inadvertently correct: Michael tells them that Pam is pregnant. While Jim and Pam ponder how Michael knew this as they\\'ve told no one at the office, the other rumors cause rampant confusion and anger, especially when Andy - who everyone has been told is gay - tries to get more information from Oscar.

He starts to reveal Stanley\\'s affair, only to be interrupted by Jim who reveals that Pam is pregnant.\\nLater, Michael gets a return phone call from Stanley\\'s wife, whom he accidentally calls Cynthia twice.

Angela snidely asks Pam if she\\'s going to introduce the office to \"Michael\\'s girlfriend\". Helene reveals that Michael got her two presents. When Kevin suggests that Helene and Michael had sex, Pam is outraged. As Helene, Jim, Pam, and Michael leave, Pam gets a \"phone call\" and tries to stay at the office by saying to the couple that her client is having a shipping emergency. However, Jim, who is having none of it, takes the phone and acts as if he\\'s resolved the issue; he hangs up and the foursome leave for the double date.\\nOn the car ride, Pam tells her mother that she likes sales. Helene suggests that Pam\\'s sales are mediocre, and Pam reflects that she shouldn\\'t have gotten in the car.\\nWhile Pam endures the date, Andy repays Dwight by giving him his suitcase back, which he polished.

Dwight says that Andy is complicating everything, but that he is not afraid.\\nMeanwhile, Pam is shocked when the waitress calls Helene, Michael, Jim and Pam the \"Scott Family.\" She shows open disdain towards Michael in a talking head. It is revealed that Michael decorated the area where the double date takes place, which causes Pam to warm up a bit.\\nMichael, however, begins to realize how old Helene is when he says he\\'d like to go to Italy someday, but instead of echoing his desire she says he can have her guidebooks and that she\\'s \"done with those really long plane rides\". Helene then jokingly says that she is 49 for the 9th year. Michael uses a pen and paper to add 49 and 9; \"you\\'re 54 years old!\" he says when done. Helene corrects him and says she\\'s 58. Michael says in interview that he\\'s not robbing the cradle, he\\'s robbing the grave. Back at the table, he is mortified when Pam and Jim suggest that Helene be called \"grandma\" and he knocks back the rest of his wine. To probe Helene\\'s attitude towards her age, Michael tries to get her to participate in a triathlon. She says no, but she might have done it when she was younger, confirming Michael\\'s fears.\\nAt Dunder Mifflin, Andy takes \"a page out of the old Schrute book of niceness\" and buys lunch for the whole office.

At the table, Michael tells Helene that he wants her to enjoy her cake before he tells her a \"terrible terrible thing\". Michael then announces he can\\'t continue to date Helene \"in good conscience\" because of Pam\\'s disapproval. Pam tells him that it is okay and that she\\'s come around. Michael abandons that line of argument, and instead breaks up with Helene by telling her, in essence, that she is too old for him.

Michael then tells Pam that he is sorry, and after extracting some clarification on what he\\'s sorry for, Pam lets him off the hook, warning him never to date a family member of hers again. He agrees, but as Pam turns away, he tries to get the last word by saying that \"for the record your mom came onto me.\" Pam abruptly turns around and slaps him hard, drawing a shocked reaction from the gathered crowd. Pam asks Michael if he is okay, but when he says \"no!\" like a crybaby, she brushes him off and walks away. Jim asks Pam if she feels better, but she says \"no, you were right\".\\nAfterward, Dwight aids Michael by holding a frozen chicken part against his swollen cheek.

Andy explains he recorded himself singing all four parts of harmony. He also repeatedly sings one portion of The Cranberries song \"Zombie.\" Despite his earlier claims of a cappella singing experience, his pitch goes flat.\\nOscar returns from his paid vacation, and Kevin asks him how he enjoyed his \"gay-cation.\" Oscar takes the joke in good humor and chuckles. This pleases Kevin, who admits he devised the joke shortly after Oscar left and had been waiting weeks for the opportunity to use it. Angela pensively invites Oscar to join the party planning committee. At first, he is offended, believing she is ridiculing him since the committee consists only of women. However, Angela respectfully continues to ask, apologizing for the way that \"certain events\" transpired. She breaks into tears explaining how she \"would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations and certain accountants...\" Oscar quickly accepts, reassuring her.\\nMichael welcomes Oscar by asking the party planning committee to have a Mexican-themed fiesta celebrating his return, offending Oscar in the process.

In a carefully choreographed plan, Jim steals Andy\\'s cell phone and leaves it with Pam. Later, Pam hands it back to Jim as he heads for the kitchen and stands guard as Jim pushes up a ceiling tile and launches the phone through the empty space to its final resting place, atop a tile roughly above Andy\\'s desk.

Andy offers to hang out with Michael, but Michael declines, requesting that Andy stop his annoying behavior.

He punches a hole in a wall, shocking his co-workers and quickly prompting a petrified Jim to hang up the phone. Michael leaves the office to try to get Dwight back.\\nMichael finds Dwight working at Staples and admits to him that he was wrong, telling Dwight that if he would go out of his way for a \"random coworker\" like Angela, he had misjudged him from the beginning. Michael apologizes and asks Dwight to return to the office.

Clark feels he is ready for the position after 12 grueling weeks of work at Dunder Mifflin, but Dwight makes it clear he doesn\\'t want Clark to get the job. Instead, he brings in a bizarre gallery of his relatives and close friends, including his cousin Mose, best friend Rolf, part-time private investigator Trevor, former Corporate executive Troy, karate teacher Sensei Ira, and a few others.\\nPam and Jim are both concerned about Dwight\\'s ideas, as Pam is worried about who will take over Jim\\'s desk and Jim feels guilty that his work in Philadelphia will leave Pam at the mercy of Dwight\\'s questionable judgment. It quickly becomes apparent, though, that none of Dwight\\'s candidates are remotely qualified to be paper salesmen, and while Dwight dismisses Clark again after he aces his interview, he is too committed to making a good hire to actually give the job to someone like Mose, Rolf or Trevor.\\nDwight gets a few cheap shots in at Jim\\'s expense when Jim makes a phone call to Wallace in hopes of getting the CEO to invest in Athlead. Jim is forced to have the conversation on speaker phone, and gets double-punched when Wallace first says that Jim\\'s salary is going to be cut to reflect his part-time status, and then bluntly shoots down the idea of putting any money towards Athlead.\\nMeanwhile, Dwight is stuck between not being able to honestly hire any of his friends and being afraid they will hate him if he doesn\\'t just pick one of them. He tries to get Jim to take over for him, and Jim refuses, but they agree to a plan where Jim will let everyone down easy by claiming he made the call to hire no one.\\nUnfortunately, Dwight completely overplays his \"anger\" at Jim for not hiring them, and Rolf and everyone else immediately realize Dwight lied to them and wasted their time. They elect to play paintball without him, later sending a rude e-mail that says \"Glad you\\'re not here\", and Dwight sadly notes that he lost all of his friends in just three hours. Clark does get the salesman job, and Pam briefly lifts Dwight\\'s spirits by suggesting they \"haze the new guy\", though she makes Dwight stop that plan when he nearly suffocates Clark with shrink wrap.

When Michael calls Vickers to see where he is, it is revealed that the man Michael has been talking to is actually Deangelo, though it takes the two some time to actually realize this.\\nDeangelo comes to the branch the next day, and most of the staff is eager to make a good first impression. Kevin wears his toupee, Jim and Pam believe they have started off well by showing Deangelo pictures of their baby, and Deangelo designates Andy as the office \"funny guy\" when he reveals that he carries name tags around to avoid situations like the one Deangelo and Michael were in. Meanwhile, Dwight is not pleased that he was not selected to replace Michael, believing that Michael put in a good recommendation for him. Michael becomes disturbed, however, when Deangelo wants to make some changes, such as how Erin answers the phone.\\nWhile Deangelo gets annoyed with Jim and Pam, he loves the antics of Andy, who has resorted to physical comedy when his jokes fall flat, getting to the point where he pours hot coffee on his pants and (at Deangelo\\'s urging) eats soap; Andy tells the camera with dazed sadness that \"this is my life now\". Deangelo\\'s popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo\\'s peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the \"multi purpose room\", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael after being approached as an ally against the new boss. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice on how to run the meeting, saying that he\\'s a good manager and Dunder Mifflin won\\'t be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room.\\nIn another effort to impress Deangelo, Jim and Pam bring in Cece, to which Deangelo reacts positively.

Pam explains to Karen that she is not sorry about what she said, but does regret putting Karen in such an awkward position.\\nIn an attempt to win Michael back, Jan arrives at the office telling him that she\\'s been more confident and better than ever after taking a vacation.

Michael attempts to reject Jan\\'s request but reverses himself immediately when he sees that Jan had a breast augmentation. Soon after, Jim and Karen leave to spend the night in New York City before their interviews. Karen tells Jim that if either of them gets the job, both should move to New York.

As Michael leaves, Wallace tells him that he won\\'t be getting the position. While being driven home by Michael, Jan begins to realize that she\\'s ruined her career and ponders making their relationship her \"full-time job,\" much to Michael\\'s visible discomfort.\\nKaren leaves to meet friends for lunch, asking Jim to call her when his interview is finished. Jim\\'s interview with David begins very well. When asked for his sales report numbers, Jim discovers Pam had slipped in an encouraging note along with a yogurt lid medal (a reference to a scene from \"Office Olympics\"). Jim, visibly distracted, stumbles through the rest of the interview until Wallace asks him where Jim thinks he will be in ten years. The scene flashes back to Jim and Pam\\'s talk after her confession on the beach. He tells her why he left and how he feels that he has never really come back. She tells him that she wishes that he would. After the interview, Jim drives back to Scranton without Karen.\\nIn her interview, Pam says she is convinced Jim will be hired in New York. She reaffirms that she is fine with the way things worked out with her and Jim and that they just \"never got the timing right.\" Her interview is interrupted when Jim bursts in and asks her if she is available that evening for dinner.

Michael is initially excited about the prospect of getting a BlackBerry, but is warned by Creed that the purpose of the program is really to get rid of older workers.\\nKelly tries to restart her relationship with Ryan, an effort he ignores until she (untruly) tells him she\\'s pregnant. He agrees to discuss the situation over dinner that night. Jim informs Pam that Dwight and Angela are secretly dating, only to discover that she has known this for quite some time.

At first she and Jim had been skeptical of Donna cheating, and even berated Michael for having destructive tendencies with his personal life, but now they realize his fears had been correct and try to warn him. Pam shows Michael the pictures she found, and he confronts Donna with the evidence. Donna then reveals that she is indeed cheating, but not on Michael, rather with Michael: She is already married to someone else.\\nIn the last scene, Dwight is taking a spin class at Donna's gym. While Dwight is instructing the class (with an imaginary scenario involving going up a hill and cycling off a cliff), the instructor tries to regain control. Everyone in the class ends up listening to Dwight.\\n\" metadata={'source': '../working/6_24_The_Cover-Up.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/4_10_Branch_Wars.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Michael believes that Karen is doing this to get back at Jim for \"dumping\" her.\\nMeanwhile, Pam, Oscar, and Toby have created a \"Finer Things Club\", where they discuss literature, music, and the arts.

Jim wants to join but Toby and Oscar feel he dominates the conversation by trying to be funny, thus diverting the conversation away from the \"finer things\". Andy wants to join because it\\'s the office\\'s most exclusive club (the party planning committee, headed by Angela, is his backup and Kevin\\'s band Scrantonicity II is his safety), but all three members shoot him down.\\nMichael and Dwight invite Jim on a \"sales call\", which is a trick to get him to go to Utica to help get back at Karen. Jim is shocked by the deception but agrees to go along in order to prevent Michael and Dwight from doing anything foolish, including using Dwight\\'s Molotov cocktails.\\n\\nWhen Karen discovers the Scranton crew trying to steal her copier, she chastises them in her office. Before they leave, she pulls Jim aside and attempts to have a civil conversation with him. She is under the impression that this prank was constructed so Jim could have an opportunity to see her.  Jim awkwardly tells her that he didn\\'t want to see her, trying not to hurt her feelings further, but does not succeed; he lets slip that he and Pam are finally dating and very happy.

The episode ends with Jim and the rest of the club wearing traditional Irish caps (Pam is wearing a scarf around her head). They are trying to discuss Angela\\'s Ashes but Jim is being disruptive by speaking candidly with an Irish brogue. He gets it out of his system and then says he found the book to be a \"fun read\". Oscar and Toby are unamused, considering the book is a tragic memoir, and do not believe Jim actually read the book.

In desperation, Jim and Dwight call in Michael, who is ecstatic at getting a chance to make a sale. However, the company ends up taking Danny\\'s offer, even after Michael promises at-cost paper sales and weekend delivery. The trio leaves the client\\'s office and head back to the Scranton branch in defeat. It is also revealed by Dwight that Danny had a romantic history with Pam (while Jim was dating Karen), a fact which Pam tries to reiterate to Jim that it was only a brief relationship.\\nDuring a brainstorm session, Michael, Jim, and Dwight decide to set up a sting operation to see how Danny is stealing all of their clients and observe his sales techniques. They set up Meredith as the CEO of Solartech (a fictional company), in Dwight\\'s office that has been fitted with security cameras, and watch from another room. Danny is then sent in to try to make a sale. All starts well until Meredith attempts to seduce him, forcing Dwight and Jim to send in Oscar and then Ryan to save the sting. When Meredith strong arms both of them, a grossed out Michael rushes in to call the whole thing off. Danny is infuriated and walks off, but before he leaves the building, Michael offers him a job. Michael points out how much money Danny would make as a traveling salesman for Dunder Mifflin, as they do have better prices and services than his current company, \"can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?\" Danny accepts the offer, and Michael introduces him as the new salesman to the office. The rest of the sales staff (minus a distracted Andy) confront Michael about this decision in his office, worried that Danny will take their clients. Michael tells them sales numbers will go up with Danny a part of the branch now, and that just because they are threatened by him being a better salesman, does not mean he should be turned away. Before Dwight leaves for the day he viciously insults Danny, then near immediately changes his tone and welcomes him to the company, scoffing at Jim\\'s confusion by replying \"It\\'s after 5:00 Jim, I\\'m not gonna take this home.\"\\nIn a final interview with the documentary crew, Michael boasts of his coup of stealing Danny, bragging that Dunder Mifflin didn\\'t even need another traveling salesman since they have Todd Packer in the field, before immediately lamenting that he \"forgot about Packer.\"\\nMeanwhile, Andy starts a band after reading about how well one of his friends is doing in the music business. He manages to get Darryl and Kevin to join him in writing a song, with Andy singing from the perspective of a little girl in a falsetto. The song is poorly received by the rest of the office, and Andy returns to the drawing board. Seeing that Andy is dejected, Kevin and Darryl offer to stay and jam with him for a little extra time, and the trio come up with another, much better song.

Andy sets up a slack line in the parking lot and makes the employees walk across it, humiliating Nellie as she insists on walking in her heels and fails to keep her balance. After Clark proves that he is talented at balancing, Dwight attempts to one-up him, but ends up failing repeatedly and hurting himself. Eventually, Dwight tries to prove his superiority by riding a bicycle across a tight-rope suspended between the roof and a telephone pole, but the photocopier he is using as a counterweight is not heavy enough and he ends up losing his balance and hanging from the bicycle above the parking lot.

Charles explains that he will tell David what he needs to know. After several weeks in which David has come to realize that Michael has little control over his branch, contacts David constantly over issues he should be able to resolve himself and resorts to extreme tactics to get a return call, David has apparently realized that the Scranton branch succeeds despite Michael, not because of him.

This begins a rivalry between Michael and Dwight, and Michael begins to steal Dwight\\'s clients. Dwight asks for a truce and offers to take Michael and his employees out to lunch; Dwight does not go to the restaurant and instead sneaks into the empty Michael Scott Paper Company office and steals everything on Michael\\'s desk, including his Rolodex contact list, and places a dead fish in the air conditioning vent.\\nMeanwhile, Jim and Pam are attempting to get bargain deals on wedding plans from Andy. When Pam turns down his ideas, Andy suspects that Pam might be acting controlling and cruelly to Jim, in the same way Angela treated Andy. Andy warns Jim, who tries to convince Andy that he and Pam are really happy. Andy remains convinced that Pam will betray him, so Jim asks Andy to provide for his emotional needs as a prank.

After a few tense moments, Stanley stands up and goes to Pam and Karen\\'s party; several other people follow him except for Kevin, Phyllis, and Hannah. Kevin tells the camera that he is mainly convinced to go because he has heard that Angela\\'s party will have double-fudge brownies, and that outweighs the fact that Angela herself will be there. Michael, Andy, Jim, and Dwight arrive at a Benihana restaurant (which Michael refers to as \"Asian Hooters\"). Andy slides into a seat next to Michael and arranges the seating so Dwight is seated on the opposite end of the table and out of earshot of the conversation of the rest of the entourage. Andy convinces Michael to ask out his Japanese waitress after getting him slightly drunk. So drunk, in fact, that he actually steals meat from the plate of Justin Spitzer, which causes a quick chopstick-sword fight between them. Unable to hear these conversations, Dwight asks Jim to fill him in, but instead Jim tricks him into telling the waitress how to properly butcher a goose, which disgusts both the waitress and the others at the table - while initially attempting to explain himself, Jim finally smiles and admits that it was just the same as all the other pranks he\\'d pulled on Dwight.

Angela is comforted by Dwight\\'s attendance at her party (even though he went to the other party first) until Karen and Pam come in and inform Dwight that he\\'s won the raffle from their party. Dwight wins walkie-talkies, which he uses later in the episode to communicate with Angela, using their pet names for one another, \"monkey\" and \"possum\".\\nPam notices how upset Angela is, and she and Karen make an offer to Angela to merge the two parties. Angela agrees and reveals that she stole the power cord for the karaoke machine. As everyone has fun singing, Michael—who is very drunk—confuses his date with Andy\\'s since, as he states, \"all waitresses look alike.\" He goes into the kitchen where both the waitresses are and he discreetly tries to ask aloud where his one was and finally she acknowledges herself and he discreetly marks her arm with a marker.\\nThe two waitresses leave because they say the party \"blows\", and Michael offers his girl a trip to Sandals Jamaica, where he was going to take Carol. She says no since she has classes, although she does take a bike that Michael had intended to give to the charity toy drive.\\nA depressed Michael sulks on the couch and Jim comes up and joins him. Jim gets Michael to laugh at the whole situation and lets him realize that what he had with the waitress was nothing more than a rebound. Jim then tells Michael that a rebound is a fun distraction, but when it is over, \"you\\'re still thinking about the girl you\\'re really after—the one who broke your heart\" (echoing Jim\\'s relationship with Karen after his being rejected by Pam). The two sit in silence as they think.\\nAs the Christmas party ends, Angela sings karaoke, Pam gives Toby her robe from corporate that Dwight had taken, and Jim and Karen give each other the same Christmas gift (a DVD copy of Bridget Jones\\'s: Edge of Reason), seeing which makes Pam sad. Later Pam receives a gift from Roy, which Jim sees. Michael makes a phone call to an unknown person (Who is later revealed to be Jan) to ask her to accompany him to Sandals; to Michael\\'s surprise, the person says yes.

At night\\'s end, Gabe and Ryan are drunkenly hanging out with Robert, refusing to leave his house and concede the end of their brown-nosing battle, even as the CEO passes out.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/8_12_Pool_Party.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/1_2_Diversity_Day.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Michael explains in his talking head that it\\'s Diversity Day and that a guest speaker is at Dunder Mifflin Scranton to talk about diversity in the workplace. Michael claims that he\\'s wanted this for a while. Corporate mandated it without Michael having to talk to them about it, though. But Michael still believes it\\'s very important.\\nJim is trying to make a sales call when Dwight begins noisily shredding paper. Jim turns off Dwight\\'s surge strip. In retaliation, Dwight disconnects Jim\\'s phone call. Jim explains to the camera that this client makes up 25% of his commission each year. He brings a small bottle of champagne to the office with him to celebrate.\\nWhile Pam plays freecell, Michael walks out of his office, then backs up when he sees the corporate representative is heading out of the conference room. He makes sure to walk out at the same time as the other man and make a point of singling out Oscar Martinez as a friend of his. Jim has made contact with his client just in time for Michael to order him into the meeting. Jim is forced to hang up again.\\nWhen the meeting begins, Michael tries to take over by talking about how he doesn\\'t even see Stanley as a black man. The representative explains that\\'s not the point here. No one is expected to be color-blind. That\\'s just fighting ignorance with more ignorance.\\nThe meeting for Diversity DayThen Michael decides everyone should go around and name an ethnicity that he or she finds sexually attractive. Dwight claims he\\'s attracted to whites and Indians. The representative does not think that\\'s a good start. He asks Michael for permission to run this session himself and suggests it would be easier if Michael sits down.\\nHe explains that he asked each of them to write down an incident that offended them. He would like volunteers to assist him. Dwight asks that they don\\'t do anything involving gays.\\nThe representative attempts to take control again from Michael who asks his name. When he reveals that it\\'s Mr. Brown, Michael thinks it\\'s a trick to see if he will call a black man Mr. Brown. Brown assures him that is his name. He goes on to explain that almost everyone wrote down the same incident and asks if everyone is familiar with the Chris Rock routine.\\nMichael complains to the camera how Chris Rock can do a hilarious routine that makes everyone laugh, but he gets in trouble from corporate when he does the same routine. Michael volunteers to be the joker, Brown doesn\\'t want the person who was the original offender in the same position. Kevin offers to be the joke teller, but doesn\\'t tell it to Michael\\'s liking. Michael interrupts with a loud, profane rendition of the routine before Brown stops him.\\nWhile Jim listens to his phone ring, helpless to answer it, Brown sets up an acronym for Hero: Honesty, Empathy, Respect and Open-Mindedness. Dwight adds additional criteria that essentially describes a super-hero, not a hero. Brown passes out forms, asking everyone sign it. Michael refuses because he didn\\'t learn anything.\\nPrivately, Brown explains that they both know he is here because of Michael\\'s behavior. Michael argues that this office is racially advanced enough that it really doesn\\'t need a diversity lecture. Brown tells him it does because it\\'s Michael that caused the need for it. He only needs Michael\\'s signature, but put the whole office through the seminar because he didn\\'t want Michael to feel singled out. Michael feigns offense that this wasn\\'t really about diversity then.\\nMichael signs the form and then jokes after the fact that he signed it \"Daffy Duck\".\\nIn the meantime, Jim has tried to call back his client and has to leave a message.\\nMichael comes out, tears up the pledge, and criticizes Mr. Brown\\'s lack of an \"Oprah moment\". He wants everyone to get as much done before lunch as possible.\\nJim gets nothing but a busy signal right before Michael forces them all into the conference room again.\\nThe HR representative, Toby Flenderson asks if they are going to sit Indian style. Michael orders him out for being offensive. Then he shows the staff a video announcing his new initiative for Diversity Tomorrow and quotes Abraham Lincoln as saying, \"If you are a racist, I will attack you with the North\".\\nKelly Kapoor, a young Indian woman, asks to be excused for a customer meeting. Michael lets her go. He introduces himself and describes his ethnic breakdown, including that he is part Native American. Oscar asks him what part he is. Michael asks about Oscar\\'s ethnicity. Oscar explains his parents were born in Mexico, moved here and he was born. Michael wants to know if there\\'s something he would like to be called besides Mexican. Oscar doesn\\'t understand why Michael would think Mexican is offensive.\\nJim, hearing his phone ring, runs out to grab it, but is too late.\\nMichael hands out cards with different ethnicities on them. The employees are to take a card and then try to guess their pretend ethnicity by how their co-workers treat them.\\nPam and Dwight trying to guess each other\\'s raceStanley is inadvertently given Black. Dwight is Asian but can\\'t guess it based upon people telling him they like his people\\'s food or eat lots of rice. Michael, who\\'s chosen Martin Luther King for himself, insists Pam stir up the pot by getting extreme. Pam hesitantly suggests to Dwight that his people aren\\'t very good drivers. Dwight angrily asks if he\\'s a woman.\\nJim goes to Pam\\'s desk where Ryan is watching an online sketch. Ryan mentions how cute she is. Jim agrees, but that Pam is engaged. Ryan says he was talking about the girl in the sketch.\\nKevin is Italian and is trying to get Angela to guess that she\\'s Jamaican by using the word \"mon\" and talking about beaches. Angela won\\'t go any further when he asks if she wants to get high.\\nIrritated that no one is trying very hard to be offensive, Michael immediately jumps on Kelly when she returns from her meeting by throwing himself into a really offensive Indian stereotype until Kelly slaps him. Michael gets visibly upset. He tells the employees how now Kelly knows what it\\'s like to be a minority.\\nJim finally gets ahold of his client who was able to close his sale with Dwight instead who gave him a discount. Jim puts the mini champagne bottle on Dwight\\'s desk.\\nPam falls asleep on Jim\\'s shoulderMichael continues mumbling about Mr. Brown and corrects Stanley on how to pronounce the word collard in collard greens. When 5 PM arrives, Pam is asleep on Jim\\'s shoulder. He smiles at the camera, then wakes her up so they can go.\\nHe tells the camera that today was a pretty good day. This is one of the first indications that Jim has feelings for Pam, and the moment is shown later in the video that he gets made for her.\\nDevon\\'s forehead card.Included on the Season 1 DVD were various deleted scenes:\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/1_2_Diversity_Day.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/7_16_PDA.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Darryl asks Andy about his Valentine\\'s Day plans with his new girlfriend Rachel, as Phyllis offers suggestions for the date. Michael and Holly then walk by and kiss before saying goodbye, only to rejoin each other and kiss repeatedly, eventually going back into Michael\\'s office while kissing. Michael reveals that it has been a week since they have started dating again, and comments \"it goes to show that everything you want in life, you get, and you can\\'t work for it. It just comes to you.\" With their newfound happiness they are oblivious that, with the exception of Kevin who enjoys watching them, the entire office is uncomfortable at their displays of affection, despite being happy for them. At Oscar\\'s prompting, Gabe holds a meeting about PDA, saying that Sabre is tolerant of office relationships, but not PDA, pointing the finger at Michael and Holly (who are shocked that the PDA meeting is about them). They both agree to stop, but while Holly follows through, Michael can\\'t help himself.\\nMichael then declares to the office that he genuinely loves Holly, who is at first taken aback, but then reciprocates. When Michael and Holly make a scene complaining about not being able to touch each other, Gabe reprimands them, suggesting that they are acting this way to have a full on relationship before Toby returns from jury duty, which would send Holly back to Nashua. Michael then becomes worried that they will have to break up again, but Holly assures him that they can make it work. Michael points out that they broke up the last time because of that and can\\'t see Holly for the rest of the day.\\nMichael then confronts Holly to tell her that he is breaking up with her. Holly, however, says that they should decide for themselves and not let the company decide their future. They both resolve to move in together and announce it to the office.\\nJim and Pam have too much champagne during lunch, causing complications when they have to return to work. During the PDA meeting, Dwight mentions a list of people who have had sex in the workplace, and Jim and Pam are among those not mentioned. After sobering up, Pam comments on how she finds it weird to have sex in the office, but eventually is drawn to the idea. They both agree to give it a try, but they have a hard time finding a place to do it, from hidden places in the warehouse to Ryan\\'s closet. They eventually return from the closet by accounting with ruffled hair and wrinkled clothing, as the entire office eyes them suspiciously. In a talking head, they claim that they have never and will never have sex in the office since they have \"a home, a bed and a shower\". However the talking head ends with a smirk from them, which on top of the wrinkled clothing after they leave the closet implies they did have sex in the closet.\\nAndy tags along on a romantic treasure hunt Gabe has made for Erin, both deciding that it is not awkward since Andy is now dating a friend of Darryl\\'s named Rachel, who was the only other Caucasian at one of Darryl\\'s parties. Andy is at first reluctant but relents at Erin\\'s friendly urging. The hunt starts with a puzzle picture, which leads to Gabe\\'s stereo in Darryl\\'s office, which leads to glow in the dark stars in Ryan\\'s closet, leading to sparkling cider at Dwight\\'s Caffeine Corner, and finally to a Valentine\\'s cookie in the break room. When the cookie tells her to enjoy her Valentine\\'s kiss, Erin thinks she\\'s supposed to kiss Andy, but he points to Gabe blowing her a kiss through the window. As Andy leaves awkwardly, Erin looks at him longingly.\\nThe final scene shows different members of the office describing their perfect Valentines, ending with Holly and Michael who when asked what they will be doing that night, make squeaking noises to imply intercourse.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/7_16_PDA.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/4_13_Dinner_Party.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Jim and Pam are welcomed by Michael and Jan, who give them a tour of the condo. One bedroom has been converted into Jan\\'s office (which appears unused); another is her workspace where she makes candles for her home business: \"Serenity by Jan.\" The aroma from the candles is overpowering. Jan then leads the guests into the master bedroom and playfully scolds Michael for not putting away the video camera tripod which was most likely from Jan filming them having sex which was mentioned in \"Women\\'s Appreciation.\"\\nMichael demonstrates how he sleeps on a small bench at the foot of the bed because Jan has \"some space issues.\" Jan has gotten her way with the home decor, although Michael takes comfort in his small plasma television mounted on the wall. Michael is also proud of a crude wooden table he built. To be polite, Jim confesses that he has no talent for crafts, and Pam joins in by mentioning that Jim couldn\\'t set up her TiVo.\\nMichael tells Pam that if she needs help, \"I\\'m just a phone call away.\" Jan angrily remarks to Michael, \"I bet you are.\"\\nWhen Andy and Angela arrive, Jan offers to take them on a short tour before starting dinner. All that\\'s left to do is braise the ossobuco, which will take three hours, she says. Pam looks horrified.\\nWhen she returns, Jan plays a music CD (\"The Hunted\") recorded by her former assistant, Hunter. The lyrics of the song and Jan\\'s provocative dancing suggest that he lost his virginity to her.\\nDuring a disastrous game of Celebrity, Jim excuses himself and pretends to have received a telephone call informing him that his apartment has flooded. His attempt to escape the party with Pam is thwarted when Michael notes that only one person needs to check on the damage. Jim concedes the point and tries to escape alone, but Pam forces a smiling Jim to stay.\\nJim returns to the game of Celebrity and undermines Michael\\'s turn by intentionally guessing the wrong names to obvious clues.\\nAfter the game, Michael tries to make a sales pitch to Jim and Andy to buy shares in Jan\\'s candle company for $10,000, which Andy immediately accepts. Pam and Angela join Jan in the kitchen, where Jan says that Michael told her that he used to date Pam. Pam is disgusted and tells Jan she never has and never wants to date Michael, but Angela quickly comments that she has noticed the way Pam stares at Michael.\\nAs dinner begins, Dwight arrives, uninvited, with his own food, two wine glasses and (apparently) his former babysitter, with whom he claims to be having a \"purely carnal\" relationship. Michael and Jan argue openly about very personal matters: while Jan debated whether or not to have children, she forced Michael to undergo a vasectomy, have it reversed, then undergo another vasectomy.\\nThe tension between Michael and Jan only grows during dinner. Michael confides in Pam that he thinks Jan has poisoned his food; Jan is upset with Michael for dipping his food in wine before eating it. Michael then plugs in a garish neon St. Pauli Girl beer sign, and the tension erupts in a shouting match. The conflict escalates until Jan throws one of Michael\\'s Dundie awards and breaks his $200 \"plasma\" television.\\nWhen the police arrive to investigate a disturbance call, Michael says that he will not press charges against Jan and will \"take the fall\" for what happened. On the advice of the responding officers, Michael agrees to go home with a friend. Jim and Pam are unavailable because Jim\\'s apartment is \"on fire\"--Pam corrects him: \"flooded.\" Dwight happily takes Michael in his car.\\nIn Michael\\'s condo, Jan tries to repair his Dundie. Jim and Pam stop at a coney island for dinner, eating in Jim\\'s car while listening to Hunter\\'s CD (which Jim stole).

Michael lets them know they aren\\'t here yet. The salespeople are especially anxious to get the leads which is causing them to snap at Michael and their co-workers. They abruptly leave the conference room. Michael tells Dwight that he would like his undivided attention. Dwight responds coldly, \"You couldn\\'t handle my undivided attention.\"\\xa0Michael explains that Sabre\\'s policy of \"Sales is King\" means that the company emphasizes the importance of the sales staff which reduces the rest of the office to support them. This has gone to the salespeople\\'s heads and is creating tension in the office.\\nJim tries to find the new leads.Dwight comes into Michael\\'s office to ask him patronizingly about news on the leads.

While this earns him the appreciation of the rest of the branch, Gabe\\xa0explains that it is Michael\\'s job to hand those leads over. So Michael hands them to the non-sales staff. Jim tries to convince Michael that this plan isn\\'t going to work.

After a few seconds of being choked by Dwight, Kevin tells him that the leads are in the trash, but Erin already threw it away. Dwight heads to the dumpster, to find nothing there. Michael realizes that it\\'s Friday and runs out into the street where a garbage truck can be seen driving away.\\nMichael asks everyone to go to the dump with him to find the leads, but only Dwight\\xa0will, fearing that Michael won\\'t be able to find them on his own. While at the dump, Michael confronts Dwight about how Dwight no longer shows him respect. Dwight admits that he resents how being under Michael\\'s tutelage hasn\\'t gone as far as he thought it would. He believes he would have been in a higher position at another company had he accepted one of the other job offers he\\'d been given. As a result, he\\'s still just a salesman at a company that failed under a boss that isn\\'t going anywhere. \"I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.\" This results in a short trash fight, which ends when Michael accidentally dumps a sink of garbage water onto himself.

Her first act, as she happily reveals, was to shut the committee down since in her opinion, \"At its worst it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best, it planned parties.\" Michael then enters the office as Santa expecting a situation, but finds to his dismay that there are no problems this Christmas. He then claims in a talking head how a wonderful Christmas with no drama is just what he wanted, as he bites his lip in annoyance. Before the party begins, the Scranton branch finds out that Holly will be replacing Toby\\xa0while he is out on jury duty, and Michael demands that Pam throw a new Christmas party to coincide with Holly\\'s return. Michael wants the Christmas party to be \"classy\", and is against doing any typical Christmas stuff that would be too childish or unsophisticated. He is under the impression that Holly will be single when she arrives, even though last time he saw her, she was dating A.J., her boyfriend from her last job. Pam\\xa0decides to give Jim a homemade comic book for Christmas (The Adventures Of Jimmy Halpert), and worries that Jim\\xa0may not like it, but he loves it and is extremely touched. Jim gives Pam a diamond bracelet which she happily accepts, after Pam spends the day speculating on what Jim made for her. Jim then admits laughingly, that while he does usually give homemade gits to Pam, there was no way he could have made a diamond bracelet.\\nMeanwhile, Darryl is worried that his daughter doesn\\'t want to spend Christmas with him. He decides that he will try and convince her to spend Christmas with him by bringing her to the office Christmas party. He is dismayed when he finds out that Michael has decided to make the party \"classy\", thus making it no fun for kids. Andy and Pam team up to give Darryl\\'s daughter a fun scavenger hunt so she will be more interested in spending Christmas with her father, but Andy inadvertently ends it prematurely. In the end she enjoys spending Christmas with Darryl, after Darryl buys her most of the items in the break room\\'s vending machines to give out to everyone and Michael eventually dresses up in a traditional Santa costume.\\nWhen Holly arrives, it turns out she is still dating her boyfriend, despite living far away from him. It is clear that she is somewhat disappointed that he hasn\\'t proposed yet, and the women in the office encourage her to give him an ultimatum, which she decides to do. Michael is so upset about her still being with A.J. that he takes it upon himself to vandalize a “Toy Story” doll of Woody that A.J. gave her, which she keeps at her desk. She angrily asks who did it and after trying to frame Toby, Michael admits it was him and that he did it out of jealousy. When asked why he is upset, Michael admits that he is hurt that while Holly claimed she loved him but they had to breakup when she transferred, she is still with A.J. despite the long distance. Later he overhears her tell A.J. that she was the one who accidentally spilled food on the doll, and realizes that she\\'s forgiven him. Pam sees an upset Michael leave the party and follows him outside to tell him about the ultimatum, and points out that it means Holly and A.J.’s relationship probably won\\'t work out. Michael agrees and says he\\'s prepared to wait it out.\\nAfter Dwight makes fun of him for being excited about snow falling, Jim leaves to gather a snowball in the parking lot and throws it at Dwight in the office. Upset, Dwight demands that Jim apologizes, but he refuses. Dwight challenges Jim to a snowball fight \"at the first real snow of winter\", which Jim is excited about, but it eventually gets intense. Dwight relentlessly pummels Jim with snowballs he had gathered in a bowl, after hiding inside a snowman, to the point that Jim is bleeding from the nose. For the rest of the day, Jim is haunted constantly by the threat of getting hit with a snowball, as Dwight repeatedly pummels Jim with snowballs whenever Jim drops his guard. Jim tells Dwight that he surrenders, but Dwight tells him there is only one thing he will accept as a condition of surrender: Jim must throw a snowball at Pam\\'s face while he watches. Horrified, Jim tells Dwight he is a psychopath, which Dwight happily takes as a refusal to surrender. Jim and Pam leave work to find the parking lot populated with snowmen and Jim frantically smashes them as a satisfied Dwight observes from the roof. Dwight then muses, \"In the end, the greatest snowball isn\\'t a snowball at all.

Dwight and Angela are less subtle than they think they are being when discussing their secret relationship within earshot of Ryan. After goofing around at the store, Jim and Pam return to the office. To \"make Kevin feel better\", Michael takes the employees out ice skating. At the rink, he also runs into his real estate agent Carol with her children and he entertains them, which puts a smile on Carol\\'s face. Kevin gets the call about his results, which turn up negative, to everyone\\'s relief except for Michael\\'s who believes that negative meant he did have cancer.

Holly explains that the Business Ethics seminar is because of Ryan\\'s fraud. Ryan tells the office what happened. He said that it was an amazing ride, even though he committed fraud. Holly discusses the questionnaires. Holly explains how time theft is horrible, but Kelly disagrees about it, telling Holly that she will take up smoking to waste time. Michael tells Holly that she is not doing a great job by setting herself up for failure.\\nOscar explains how the meeting is not about true ethics. Then, Andy asks Michael whether he would take bread for his family or if he would let his family go hungry. Michael can\\'t decide.\\nHolly tries to get some of her coworkers to discuss times where they were faced with ethical dilemmas, which they misinterpret as a platform to mention rules that they have broken, encouraged by Michael falsely saying they have “immunity.” Michael admits that when he discovered YouTube, he didn\\'t work for five days. Oscar says that sometimes he takes a long lunch. Kelly says she downloads pirated music on to her work computer. Dwight tells Michael to fire Oscar. Angela says she reported Oscar to the INS.

Holly is shocked and tries to get Michael to discipline her, however, Michael laughs it off, jokingly calls Meredith a “dirty girl” and doesn\\'t believe that the situation is that serious.\\nHolly asks Meredith questions. Michael tries to feed Meredith advice and tells her to say that the sexual meetings were personal, but Meredith admits that it was only for the steaks and the lower prices.

Holly wants Meredith to be fired, but has trouble expressing this as Michael continuously dodges the conversation and treats their lunch like a date. Michael has an uncomfortable talk with Holly about chastity belts. Michael tells Holly that Meredith needs this job, but Holly disagrees with this being a justification for her actions and feels that Michael\\'s attempts to brush the issue under the rug is wrong.

During the service, Cece\\'s dress is ruined when Jim changes her diaper. Jim scrambles to replace the gown, and Cece is eventually baptized in an Arcade Fire t-shirt he found in the back of his car. At the end of the mass, the minister announces there will be a reception hosted by Jim and Pam, who panic because they were expecting only family and are not prepared for so many guests.\\nAt the reception, food quickly runs out and Cece goes missing after Jim asks Pam\\'s grandmother to keep an eye on her. After finding out from guests that Cece was last seen with a \"short blonde woman\" (Pam\\'s mother Helene, who was changing Cece), Jim thinks Angela (who has insulted Jim and Pam but adored Cece all day) has kidnapped Cece, and calls her out as she is leaving. Believing her to be the kidnapper, Kevin attacks Angela\\'s purse, where she has hoarded some of the food meant for the guests.\\nWhile Dwight uses the event to try to sell paper and printers, Toby finally enters the church after the ceremony. He looks at the crucifix and simply, achingly asks, \"Why do you have to be so mean to me?\"\\nMichael is inspired by the fellow churchgoers, especially the youth ministry, which is going to Mexico to help build a school for underprivileged children. As the kids leave, Michael shakes hands with every one of them and wishes them luck, before hopping on the bus himself. The other employees try to talk him out of it (with the notable exception of Darryl), but Michael refuses. Just before they leave, Andy (in another attempt to impress Erin) boards the bus with him. Both realize their mistake 45 minutes into the trip, and force the bus to stop. They (along with a kid from the youth ministry who left with them) then have Erin drive them home while having a good laugh about it, and Michael is happy to hear that the rest of his staff went out together to see a movie.\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/7_7_Christening.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/4_15_Night_Out.md'}\ndoc: page_content='The episode begins with Ryan arriving at the Scranton branch and noticeably friendlier than on his previous visits. Ryan shows the staff at the branch the new Dunder Mifflin website, \"Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2.0\", the previous version of which was shut down because sexual predators had invaded the social networking component of the site. As Ryan leaves, he tells Michael\\xa0of the women he meets in clubs in New York City. Michael and Dwight\\xa0subsequently decide to go to New York, locate Ryan, attend parties with him, and try to meet women while doing so.\\nIn New York, Michael and Dwight locate Ryan after discovering which club Ryan frequents; the latter appears to be under the influence of drugs (coke) but Michael and Dwight do not notice. Later, Michael, Dwight, Ryan, and Ryan\\'s colleague, Troy Underbridge wait outside another club, but fail to get in because they do not have dates. Dwight comes to the rescue when he manages to pair each of them with members of a women\\'s basketball team, who are also waiting in line. Inside the club, Ryan\\'s dancing becomes erratic and aggressive, and he accidentally hits a girl, prompting her friends to attack Ryan. Dwight and Michael escort him out of the club, and after Troy advises them not to take Ryan to a hospital, he runs off. Michael and Dwight bring Ryan back to his apartment, where he tells them that he thinks \"his friend Troy\" has a drug problem, and asks what he should do about it. Michael, oblivious to the fact that Ryan is obviously referring to his own drug addiction, gives him hypothetical advice involving a wiretap and snitching on a drug dealer.  \\nJim, Pam and Toby locked in the buildingBack in Scranton, the rest of the employees are going to be forced to work on a Saturday to record their own sales as the website\\'s sales, which is, according to Ryan, \"a temporary procedure to increase the legitimacy of the website\". With no one eager to participate, Jim\\xa0decides to ask everyone to stay in the office overtime instead of coming in on Saturday. They all agree to the plan, and after working until 9:00\\xa0, they are shocked to find the parking lot gates locked. Jim had forgotten to tell the security guard that they were staying overtime. They are unable to return to the office because Pam\\xa0locked the door from the inside, and Dwight, miles away in New York, has both the spare and master keys. Sitting in the lobby area waiting for the security guard to arrive, the employees exchange jokes and during a moment of levity, Toby\\xa0affectionately places his hand on Pam\\'s knee. After an awkward silence, Toby proclaims that he is moving to Costa Rica; he then hops the parking lot fence and runs away. Jim repeatedly calls Hank,\\xa0the security guard, but he fails to show up. At the end of the episode, the cleaning staff arrives and lets the group out. Later, Hank shows up and discovers that they are not there.\\n\\n' metadata={'source': '../working/4_15_Night_Out.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/5_6_Employee_Transfer.md'}\ndoc: page_content='Holly has been transferred back to her old branch in Nashua, New Hampshire after CFO David Wallace discovered her relationship with Michael. Michael and Darryl help her move using Darryl\\'s truck. Michael and Holly want to continue their relationship, but as they get closer to Nashua, Holly starts to come to the realization that their relationship is not going to work with the long distance, citing the seven hour drive. Michael continuously begs her to keep their relationship alive as he fears he will go back to Jan.\\nMichael had originally intended to spend the weekend with Holly before heading back to Scranton, but after they move her stuff into her new house, he changes his mind and decides to head back with Darryl. Michael and Holly share one last embrace before he leaves. In the truck, Darryl tries to console Michael by teaching him to sing the blues, which Michael does not understand but ultimately joins in.\\nJim meets Pam in New York for lunch with his brothers, Tom and Pete. Pam, Tom, and Pete arrive early to discuss a prank Pam wants to play on Jim that involves her engagement ring. Tom and Pete, however, think of playing a prank involving her interest in art, which she agrees to, though she appears to be mildly offended. When Jim arrives, Tom and Pete begin mocking Pam\\'s interest in art, and Jim continuously comes to her defense.\\nWhen the argument becomes heated, Tom and Pete reveal it was a prank, and Jim and Pam stare awkwardly at each other. Later, when Jim and Pam are walking outside of the restaurant, Pam explains her original idea for the prank, which Jim appreciates much more than his brothers\\' idea. Moments later, Jim receives a text message from his brother stating his approval of Pam and welcoming her to the family.\\nMeanwhile, back in Scranton, Dwight comes in wearing a Cornell sweatshirt, which irritates Andy, who thinks Dwight is mocking him. Dwight tries to talk about Cornell with Andy and tells him that he is going to apply there. He further installs a Cornell pennant and a Cornell mascot bobblehead in his area. Unable to take any more of Dwight\\'s mocking, Andy calls the university and is given permission to give Dwight his interview for admission.\\nAndy has no intention of allowing Dwight to pass, but during the interview, Dwight notices inconsistencies with Andy\\'s questions such as asking who was Cornell\\'s eighth president, which Dwight answers correctly as Dale R. Corson, but Andy replies that Cornell\\'s seventh president was James A. Perkins. Then Dwight starts writing down his critique of Andy\\'s interviewing skills, which he tells him he is going to send to the university. Dwight additionally gets to Andy by proclaiming his newfound desire to change his application to the \"vastly superior Dartmouth,\" which becomes the last straw for Andy.\\nAfter a heated physical struggle with the conference room table, Andy gives up. At the end of the episode, Andy comes into the office in overalls, a farmer\\'s hat, and a basket of beets, saying he is starting his own beet farm, hence trying to be like Dwight. Dwight, however, is quick to point out Andy\\'s knowledge of beets, or lack thereof. Through the day Angela is seen to be annoyed by both Andy and Dwight\\'s antics, but does not speak up against either one.\\nCreed\\'s Joker Outfit' metadata={'source': '../working/5_6_Employee_Transfer.md'}\ndoc: {'source': '../working/4_14_Chair_Model.md'}\ndoc: page_content=\"Michael's fascination with a woman modeling a chair in an office supply catalog makes him feel things he hasn't felt in a while.

Jim and Pam talk about Cecilia, and Jim is sad that he is missing it.

It is her last day at Dunder Mifflin Scranton for a while, and she says that the people at the branch are lovely. Michael comes to talk to Jo and gives her a gift. She thanks him and offers him a room at her house in Tallahassee, which he takes very seriously. Jo holds an office meeting and asks if anyone has any ideas relating to the business. Michael bothers Jo by telling her details about everyone who asks her a question and tries to get her to like him. Darryl tells Jo about how Sabre\\'s delivery system isn\\'t efficient, and proposes a better alternative. Jo accepts Darryl\\'s plan and, being impressed, offers Darryl Jim\\'s old office. Gabe tells her that he is working there, but scared of Jo, tells her that it\\'s okay and he will go clean it out immediately.\\nMichael hugs Jo and tells her he bought tickets and planned a trip to visit Jo in Tallahassee. Jo is shocked, and says that he should have checked with her office. When Michael continues to bother her, she snaps and tells Michael, \"Enough!\" leaving the office in shock. Michael is confused why Jo still doesn\\'t like him despite his attempts. Michael asks Jo out to lunch, and she tells him to do some work. Michael asks Darryl why Jo likes him and asks him if her family owes him something. Michael says that he is going home for the day, and Jo says that he can go if he believes that he did a great day of work, while she decides to stay to work. Michael tells everyone not to leave because Jo wants them to stay until they have done superb work. Kevin then throws his hat on the floor and expresses his outrage in a talking head.\\nDwight claims to have a late meeting with a client, but Jim gets in ahead of him and tells Jo that he himself has to meet a late client, but stresses that such meetings never happen normally. Dwight tries to tell Jo that he has a late client meeting, only to tell her he will reschedule after she stares him down. Michael calls an inebriated Todd Packer who\\'s been drinking since three and complains that the girls are fat and ugly. Glenn and the rest of the warehouse workers come to ask Darryl to leave to celebrate, but he turns them down after Jo glares at him. The cleaning crew comes to the office, but then awkwardly leave since Jo and everyone else are still there. Angela explains in a talking head that she wants to leave, not to celebrate, but instead protest St. Patrick\\'s Day. Gabe helps get Jo\\'s bags and explains that he has no time for a personal life because Jo is very demanding. Michael enters the conference room, explains to Jo that it\\'s a holiday and he is dismissing his hard-working employees so they can enjoy their evening. He also lets her know that he\\'s cancelled his Florida trip, but is looking forward to their working relationship, a sentiment she reciprocates.\\nTodd Packer and Michael enjoy the St. Patrick\\'s Day party at Cooper\\'s. Michael says that he rather be with people he likes than Jo who he has just met.

Jo sends her home, because she doesn\\'t want her dogs to catch a bug. Andy decides to pretend to be sick in front of Jo, who also sends him home. Andy comes to Erin\\'s house, even though she is sick and they hold hands while watching a movie.

Andy leaves the date dejected, until Erin kisses him on the cheek to his happiness.\\nAndy has an \"interesting\" first date.Dwight enters the office the next day and sees Jim sitting at the top of the three desks that have been arranged to form what Jim calls \"Quad-Desk.\" Dwight points out the name is illogical since there are only three desks, and Jim sighs and says they will have to rename it then. A phone then rings from below the desks and Dwight bends down to see his nameplate and phone on a small desk.
