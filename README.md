# Overview

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook that I used to build my [office oracle project](https://github.com/zackproser/office-oracle).

It is the companion notebook to my [office oracle test notebook](https://github.com/zackproser/office-oracle-db-test-notebook).

This notebook handles reading, parsing, embedding and upserting data into a Pinecone vector database, whereas the test notebook linked above
is concerned with verifying data quality for the purpose of the AI chatbot application.

I open sourced it to share an approach that works well for building abitrary AI chatbots with any identity, trained on any 
corpus of knowledge, and expected to answer factually based on that knowledge. 

## Usage 

You can run this anywhere that you can run a Jupyter notebook. I used Kaggle.com personally.
